# ImageObject

An image file.

## Type Hierarchy

ImageObject is a type of MediaObject.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from ImageObject:

- Barcode: An image of a visual machine-readable code such as a barcode or QR code.
- ImageObjectSnapshot: A specific and exact (byte-for-byte) version of an [[ImageObject]]. Two byte-for-byte identical files, for the purposes of this type, considered identical. If they have different embedded metadata (e.g. XMP, EXIF) the files will differ. Different external facts about the files, e.g. creator or dateCreated that aren't represented in their actual content, do not affect this notion of identity.

## Properties

ImageObject defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from MediaObject:

- exifData: exif data for this object.
- representativeOfPage: Indicates whether this image is representative of the content of the page.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface ImageObject {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'ImageObject'
  exifData?: PropertyValue | string
  representativeOfPage?: boolean
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "ImageObject",
  "name": "Example ImageObject",
  "description": "An example of the ImageObject type",
  "url": "https://example.com/imageobject",
  "identifier": "example-imageobject-1"
}
```

## Notes

- ImageObject inherits all properties from MediaObject
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
