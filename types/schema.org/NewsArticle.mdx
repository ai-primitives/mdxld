# NewsArticle

A NewsArticle is an article whose content reports news, or provides background context and supporting materials for understanding the news.

A more detailed overview of [schema.org News markup](/docs/news.html) is also available.


## Type Hierarchy

NewsArticle is a type of Article.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from NewsArticle:

- AnalysisNewsArticle: An AnalysisNewsArticle is a [[NewsArticle]] that, while based on factual reporting, incorporates the expertise of the author/producer, offering interpretations and conclusions.
- AskPublicNewsArticle: A [[NewsArticle]] expressing an open call by a [[NewsMediaOrganization]] asking the public for input, insights, clarifications, anecdotes, documentation, etc., on an issue, for reporting purposes.
- BackgroundNewsArticle: A [[NewsArticle]] providing historical context, definition and detail on a specific topic (aka "explainer" or "backgrounder"). For example, an in-depth article or frequently-asked-questions ([FAQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAQ)) document on topics such as Climate Change or the European Union. Other kinds of background material from a non-news setting are often described using [[Book]] or [[Article]], in particular [[ScholarlyArticle]]. See also [[NewsArticle]] for related vocabulary from a learning/education perspective.
- OpinionNewsArticle: An [[OpinionNewsArticle]] is a [[NewsArticle]] that primarily expresses opinions rather than journalistic reporting of news and events. For example, a [[NewsArticle]] consisting of a column or [[Blog]]/[[BlogPosting]] entry in the Opinions section of a news publication. 
- ReportageNewsArticle: The [[ReportageNewsArticle]] type is a subtype of [[NewsArticle]] representing
 news articles which are the result of journalistic news reporting conventions.

In practice many news publishers produce a wide variety of article types, many of which might be considered a [[NewsArticle]] but not a [[ReportageNewsArticle]]. For example, opinion pieces, reviews, analysis, sponsored or satirical articles, or articles that combine several of these elements.

The [[ReportageNewsArticle]] type is based on a stricter ideal for "news" as a work of journalism, with articles based on factual information either observed or verified by the author, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.  This often includes perspectives from multiple viewpoints on a particular issue (distinguishing news reports from public relations or propaganda).  News reports in the [[ReportageNewsArticle]] sense de-emphasize the opinion of the author, with commentary and value judgements typically expressed elsewhere.

A [[ReportageNewsArticle]] which goes deeper into analysis can also be marked with an additional type of [[AnalysisNewsArticle]].


## Properties

NewsArticle defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from Article:

- dateline: A [dateline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dateline) is a brief piece of text included in news articles that describes where and when the story was written or filed though the date is often omitted. Sometimes only a placename is provided.

Structured representations of dateline-related information can also be expressed more explicitly using [[locationCreated]] (which represents where a work was created, e.g. where a news report was written).  For location depicted or described in the content, use [[contentLocation]].

Dateline summaries are oriented more towards human readers than towards automated processing, and can vary substantially. Some examples: "BEIRUT, Lebanon, June 2.", "Paris, France", "December 19, 2017 11:43AM Reporting from Washington", "Beijing/Moscow", "QUEZON CITY, Philippines".
      
- printColumn: The number of the column in which the NewsArticle appears in the print edition.
- printEdition: The edition of the print product in which the NewsArticle appears.
- printPage: If this NewsArticle appears in print, this field indicates the name of the page on which the article is found. Please note that this field is intended for the exact page name (e.g. A5, B18).
- printSection: If this NewsArticle appears in print, this field indicates the print section in which the article appeared.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface NewsArticle {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'NewsArticle'
  dateline?: string
  printColumn?: string
  printEdition?: string
  printPage?: string
  printSection?: string
}
```

## Example Usage

{
  "$context": "schema.org",

  "name": "Example NewsArticle",
  "description": "An example of the NewsArticle type",
  "url": "https://example.com/newsarticle",
  "identifier": "example-newsarticle-1"
}
