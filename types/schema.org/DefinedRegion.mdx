  $type: 'DefinedRegion'
  addressCountry?: Country | string
  postalCode?: string
  addressRegion?: string
  postalCodePrefix?: string
  postalCodeRange?: PostalCodeRangeSpecification
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{

## Notes

- DefinedRegion inherits all properties from StructuredValue
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
