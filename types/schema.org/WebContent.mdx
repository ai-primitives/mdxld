# WebContent

WebContent is a type representing all [[WebPage]], [[WebSite]] and [[WebPageElement]] content. It is sometimes the case that detailed distinctions between Web pages, sites and their parts are not always important or obvious.

(The intent is that the existing types [[WebPage]], [[WebSite]] and [[WebPageElement]] will eventually be declared as subtypes of [[WebContent]].)

## Type Hierarchy

WebContent is a type of CreativeWork.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from WebContent:

Such content may be comprised of several parts or sections and use different types of media. Multiple instances of [[WebContent]] (and hence [[HealthTopicContent]]) can be related using [[hasPart]] / [[isPartOf]] where there is some kind of content hierarchy, and their content described with [[about]] and [[mentions]] e.g. building upon the existing [[MedicalCondition]] vocabulary.
