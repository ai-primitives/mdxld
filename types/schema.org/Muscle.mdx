# Muscle

A muscle is an anatomical structure consisting of a contractile form of tissue that animals use to effect movement.

## Type Hierarchy

Muscle is a type of AnatomicalStructure.

### Direct Subtypes

No types directly inherit from Muscle.

## Properties

Muscle defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from AnatomicalStructure:

- antagonist: The muscle whose action counteracts the specified muscle.
- bloodSupply: The blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the muscle.
- insertion: The place of attachment of a muscle, or what the muscle moves.
- muscleAction: The movement the muscle generates.
- nerve: The underlying innervation associated with the muscle.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface Muscle {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'Muscle'
  antagonist?: Muscle
  bloodSupply?: Vessel
  insertion?: AnatomicalStructure
  muscleAction?: string
  nerve?: Nerve
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "Muscle",
  "name": "Example Muscle",
  "description": "An example of the Muscle type",
  "url": "https://example.com/muscle",
  "identifier": "example-muscle-1"
}
```

## Notes

- Muscle inherits all properties from AnatomicalStructure
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
