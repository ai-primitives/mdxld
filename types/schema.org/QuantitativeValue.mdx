# QuantitativeValue

 A point value or interval for product characteristics and other purposes.

## Type Hierarchy

QuantitativeValue is a type of StructuredValue.

### Direct Subtypes

No types directly inherit from QuantitativeValue.

## Properties

### Direct Properties

- additionalProperty: A property-value pair representing an additional characteristic of the entity, e.g. a product feature or another characteristic for which there is no matching property in schema.org.\n\nNote: Publishers should be aware that applications designed to use specific schema.org properties (e.g. https://schema.org/width, https://schema.org/color, https://schema.org/gtin13, ...) will typically expect such data to be provided using those properties, rather than using the generic property/value mechanism.

- minValue: The lower value of some characteristic or property.
- maxValue: The upper value of some characteristic or property.
- unitCode: The unit of measurement given using the UN/CEFACT Common Code (3 characters) or a URL. Other codes than the UN/CEFACT Common Code may be used with a prefix followed by a colon.
- value: The value of a [[QuantitativeValue]] (including [[Observation]]) or property value node.\n\n* For [[QuantitativeValue]] and [[MonetaryAmount]], the recommended type for values is 'Number'.\n* For [[PropertyValue]], it can be 'Text', 'Number', 'Boolean', or 'StructuredValue'.\n* Use values from 0123456789 (Unicode 'DIGIT ZERO' (U+0030) to 'DIGIT NINE' (U+0039)) rather than superficially similar Unicode symbols.\n* Use '.'

- valueReference: A secondary value that provides additional information on the original value, e.g. a reference temperature or a type of measurement.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface QuantitativeValue extends StructuredValue {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'QuantitativeValue'
  additionalProperty?: PropertyValue
  minValue?: number
  maxValue?: number
  unitCode?: string
  value?: StructuredValue | boolean | number | string
  valueReference?: DefinedTerm | Enumeration | MeasurementTypeEnumeration | PropertyValue | QualitativeValue | QuantitativeValue | StructuredValue | string
  unitText?: string
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "QuantitativeValue",
  "name": "Example QuantitativeValue",
  "description": "An example of the QuantitativeValue type",
  "url": "https://example.com/quantitativevalue",
  "identifier": "example-quantitativevalue-1"
}
```

## Notes

- QuantitativeValue inherits all properties from StructuredValue
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
