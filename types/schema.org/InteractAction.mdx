## Type Hierarchy

InteractAction is a type of Action.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from InteractAction:

- BefriendAction: The act of forming a personal connection with someone (object) mutually/bidirectionally/symmetrically.\n\nRelated actions:\n\n* [[FollowAction]]: Unlike FollowAction, BefriendAction implies that the connection is reciprocal.
- CommunicateAction: The act of conveying information to another person via a communication medium (instrument) such as speech, email, or telephone conversation.
- FollowAction: The act of forming a personal connection with someone/something (object) unidirectionally/asymmetrically to get updates polled from.\n\nRelated actions:\n\n* [[BefriendAction]]: Unlike BefriendAction, FollowAction implies that the connection is *not* necessarily reciprocal.\n* [[SubscribeAction]]: Unlike SubscribeAction, FollowAction implies that the follower acts as an active agent constantly/actively polling for updates.\n* [[RegisterAction]]: Unlike RegisterAction, FollowAction implies that the agent is interested in continuing receiving updates from the object.\n* [[JoinAction]]: Unlike JoinAction, FollowAction implies that the agent is interested in getting updates from the object.\n* [[TrackAction]]: Unlike TrackAction, FollowAction refers to the polling of updates of all aspects of animate objects rather than the location of inanimate objects (e.g. you track a package, but you don't follow it).
- JoinAction: An agent joins an event/group with participants/friends at a location.\n\nRelated actions:\n\n* [[RegisterAction]]: Unlike RegisterAction, JoinAction refers to joining a group/team of people.\n* [[SubscribeAction]]: Unlike SubscribeAction, JoinAction does not imply that you'll be receiving updates.\n* [[FollowAction]]: Unlike FollowAction, JoinAction does not imply that you'll be polling for updates.
- LeaveAction: An agent leaves an event / group with participants/friends at a location.\n\nRelated actions:\n\n* [[JoinAction]]: The antonym of LeaveAction.\n* [[UnRegisterAction]]: Unlike UnRegisterAction, LeaveAction implies leaving a group/team of people rather than a service.
- MarryAction: The act of marrying a person.
- RegisterAction: The act of registering to be a user of a service, product or web page.\n\nRelated actions:\n\n* [[JoinAction]]: Unlike JoinAction, RegisterAction implies you are registering to be a user of a service, *not* a group/team of people.\n* [[FollowAction]]: Unlike FollowAction, RegisterAction doesn't imply that the agent is expecting to poll for updates from the object.\n* [[SubscribeAction]]: Unlike SubscribeAction, RegisterAction doesn't imply that the agent is expecting updates from the object.
- SubscribeAction: The act of forming a personal connection with someone/something (object) unidirectionally/asymmetrically to get updates pushed to.\n\nRelated actions:\n\n* [[FollowAction]]: Unlike FollowAction, SubscribeAction implies that the subscriber acts as a passive agent being constantly/actively pushed for updates.\n* [[RegisterAction]]: Unlike RegisterAction, SubscribeAction implies that the agent is interested in continuing receiving updates from the object.\n* [[JoinAction]]: Unlike JoinAction, SubscribeAction implies that the agent is interested in continuing receiving updates from the object.
- UnRegisterAction: The act of un-registering from a service.\n\nRelated actions:\n\n* [[RegisterAction]]: antonym of UnRegisterAction.\n* [[LeaveAction]]: Unlike LeaveAction, UnRegisterAction implies that you are unregistering from a service you were previously registered, rather than leaving a team/group of people.
