# Quantity

Quantities such as distance, time, mass, weight, etc. Particular instances of say Mass are entities like '3 kg' or '4 milligrams'.

## Type Hierarchy

Quantity is a type of Intangible.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from Quantity:

- Distance: Properties that take Distances as values are of the form '&lt;Number&gt; &lt;Length unit of measure&gt;'. E.g., '7 ft'.
- Duration: Quantity: Duration (use [ISO 8601 duration format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)).
- Energy: Properties that take Energy as values are of the form '&lt;Number&gt; &lt;Energy unit of measure&gt;'.
- Mass: Properties that take Mass as values are of the form '&lt;Number&gt; &lt;Mass unit of measure&gt;'. E.g., '7 kg'.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface Quantity extends Intangible {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'Quantity'

}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "Quantity",
  "name": "Example Quantity",
  "description": "An example of the Quantity type",
  "url": "https://example.com/quantity",
  "identifier": "example-quantity-1"
}
```

## Notes

- Quantity inherits all properties from Intangible
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
