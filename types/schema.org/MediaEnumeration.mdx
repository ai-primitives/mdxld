# MediaEnumeration

MediaEnumeration enumerations are lists of codes, labels etc. useful for describing media objects. They may be reflections of externally developed lists, or created at schema.org, or a combination.

## Type Hierarchy

MediaEnumeration is a type of Enumeration.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from MediaEnumeration:

- IPTCDigitalSourceEnumeration: <a href="https://www.iptc.org/">IPTC</a> "Digital Source" codes for use with the [[digitalSourceType]] property, providing information about the source for a digital media object.
In general these codes are not declared here to be mutually exclusive, although some combinations would be contradictory if applied simultaneously, or might be considered mutually incompatible by upstream maintainers of the definitions. See the IPTC <a href="https://www.iptc.org/std/photometadata/documentation/userguide/">documentation</a>
