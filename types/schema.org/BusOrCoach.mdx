      type: PropertyValue
      description: A property-value pair representing an additional characteristic of the entity, e.g. a product feature or another characteristic for which there is no matching property in schema.org.\n\nNote: Publishers should be aware that applications designed to use specific schema.org properties (e.g. https://schema.org/width, https://schema.org/color, https://schema.org/gtin13, ...) will typically expect such data to be provided using those properties, rather than using the generic property/value mechanism.

    - name: mobileUrl
      type: string
      description: The [[mobileUrl]] property is provided for specific situations in which data consumers need to determine whether one of several provided URLs is a dedicated 'mobile site'.

To discourage over-use, and reflecting intial usecases, the property is expected only on [[Product]] and [[Offer]], rather than [[Thing]]. The general trend in web technology is towards [responsive design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design) in which content can be flexibly adapted to a wide range of browsing environments. Pages and sites referenced with the long-established [[url]] property should ideally also be usable on a wide variety of devices, including mobile phones. In most cases, it would be pointless and counter productive to attempt to update all [[url]] markup to use [[mobileUrl]] for more mobile-oriented pages. The property is intended for the case when items (primarily [[Product]] and [[Offer]]) have extra URLs hosted on an additional "mobile site" alongside the main one. It should not be taken as an endorsement of this publication style.

      description: A Global Trade Item Number ([GTIN](https://www.gs1.org/standards/id-keys/gtin)). GTINs identify trade items, including products and services, using numeric identification codes.

A correct [[gtin]] value should be a valid GTIN, which means that it should be an all-numeric string of either 8, 12, 13 or 14 digits, or a "GS1 Digital Link" URL based on such a string. The numeric component should also have a [valid GS1 check digit](https://www.gs1.org/services/check-digit-calculator) and meet the other rules for valid GTINs. See also [GS1's GTIN Summary](http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/idkeys/gtin) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Trade_Item_Number) for more details. Left-padding of the gtin values is not required or encouraged. The [[gtin]] property generalizes the earlier [[gtin8]], [[gtin12]], [[gtin13]], and [[gtin14]] properties.

The GS1 [digital link specifications](https://www.gs1.org/standards/Digital-Link/) expresses GTINs as URLs (URIs, IRIs, etc.).
Digital Links should be populated into the [[hasGS1DigitalLink]] attribute.

Note also that this is a definition for how to include GTINs in Schema.org data, and not a definition of GTINs in general - see the GS1 documentation for authoritative details.

In the case of a [[ProductGroup]], the group description also serves as a template, representing a set of Products that vary on explicitly defined, specific dimensions only (so it defines both a set of variants, as well as which values distinguish amongst those variants). When used with [[ProductGroup]], this property can apply to any [[Product]] included in the group.

In the case of a [[Review]], the property describes the [[itemReviewed]] from the perspective of the review; in the case of a [[Product]], the product itself is being described. Since product descriptions 
tend to emphasise positive claims, it may be relatively unusual to find [[negativeNotes]] used in this way. Nevertheless for the sake of symmetry, [[negativeNotes]] can be used on [[Product]].

- fuelConsumption: The amount of fuel consumed for traveling a particular distance or temporal duration with the given vehicle (e.g. liters per 100 km).\n\n* Note 1: There are unfortunately no standard unit codes for liters per 100 km.  Use [[unitText]] to indicate the unit of measurement, e.g. L/100 km.\n* Note 2: There are two ways of indicating the fuel consumption, [[fuelConsumption]] (e.g. 8 liters per 100 km) and [[fuelEfficiency]] (e.g. 30 miles per gallon). They are reciprocal.\n* Note 3: Often, the absolute value is useful only when related to driving speed ("at 80 km/h") or usage pattern ("city traffic").

Simply use "SEC" for seconds and indicate the velocities in the [[name]] of the [[QuantitativeValue]], or use [[valueReference]] with a [[QuantitativeValue]] of 0..60 mph or 0..100 km/h to specify the reference speeds. (inherited from Vehicle)
- vehicleEngine: Information about the engine or engines of the vehicle. (inherited from Vehicle)
- weightTotal: The permitted total weight of the loaded vehicle, including passengers and cargo and the weight of the empty vehicle.\n\nTypical unit code(s): KGM for kilogram, LBR for pound\n\n* Note 1: You can indicate additional information in the [[name]] of the [[QuantitativeValue]] node.\n* Note 2: You may also link to a [[QualitativeValue]] node that provides additional information using [[valueReference]].\n* Note 3: Note that you can use [[minValue]] and [[maxValue]] to indicate ranges. (inherited from Vehicle)

You can link to information about how the given value has been determined using the [[valueReference]] property. (inherited from Vehicle)
- vehicleInteriorType: The type or material of the interior of the vehicle (e.g. synthetic fabric, leather, wood, etc.). While most interior types are characterized by the material used, an interior type can also be based on vehicle usage or target audience. (inherited from Vehicle)
- fuelEfficiency: The distance traveled per unit of fuel used; most commonly miles per gallon (mpg) or kilometers per liter (km/L).\n\n* Note 1: There are unfortunately no standard unit codes for miles per gallon or kilometers per liter. Use [[unitText]] to indicate the unit of measurement, e.g. mpg or km/L.\n* Note 2: There are two ways of indicating the fuel consumption, [[fuelConsumption]] (e.g. 8 liters per 100 km) and [[fuelEfficiency]] (e.g. 30 miles per gallon). They are reciprocal.\n* Note 3: Often, the absolute value is useful only when related to driving speed ("at 80 km/h") or usage pattern ("city traffic"). You can use [[valueReference]] to link the value for the fuel economy to another value. (inherited from Vehicle)
- dateVehicleFirstRegistered: The date of the first registration of the vehicle with the respective public authorities. (inherited from Vehicle)
- fuelType: The type of fuel suitable for the engine or engines of the vehicle. If the vehicle has only one engine, this property can be attached directly to the vehicle. (inherited from Vehicle)
- bodyType: Indicates the design and body style of the vehicle (e.g. station wagon, hatchback, etc.). (inherited from Vehicle)
- driveWheelConfiguration: The drive wheel configuration, i.e. which roadwheels will receive torque from the vehicle's engine via the drivetrain. (inherited from Vehicle)
- tongueWeight: The permitted vertical load (TWR) of a trailer attached to the vehicle. Also referred to as Tongue Load Rating (TLR) or Vertical Load Rating (VLR).\n\nTypical unit code(s): KGM for kilogram, LBR for pound\n\n* Note 1: You can indicate additional information in the [[name]] of the [[QuantitativeValue]] node.\n* Note 2: You may also link to a [[QualitativeValue]] node that provides additional information using [[valueReference]].\n* Note 3: Note that you can use [[minValue]] and [[maxValue]] to indicate ranges. (inherited from Vehicle)

- additionalProperty: A property-value pair representing an additional characteristic of the entity, e.g. a product feature or another characteristic for which there is no matching property in schema.org.\n\nNote: Publishers should be aware that applications designed to use specific schema.org properties (e.g. https://schema.org/width, https://schema.org/color, https://schema.org/gtin13, ...) will typically expect such data to be provided using those properties, rather than using the generic property/value mechanism.
 (inherited from Product)
- mobileUrl: The [[mobileUrl]] property is provided for specific situations in which data consumers need to determine whether one of several provided URLs is a dedicated 'mobile site'.

To discourage over-use, and reflecting intial usecases, the property is expected only on [[Product]] and [[Offer]], rather than [[Thing]]. The general trend in web technology is towards [responsive design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design) in which content can be flexibly adapted to a wide range of browsing environments. Pages and sites referenced with the long-established [[url]] property should ideally also be usable on a wide variety of devices, including mobile phones. In most cases, it would be pointless and counter productive to attempt to update all [[url]] markup to use [[mobileUrl]] for more mobile-oriented pages. The property is intended for the case when items (primarily [[Product]] and [[Offer]]) have extra URLs hosted on an additional "mobile site" alongside the main one. It should not be taken as an endorsement of this publication style.
     (inherited from Product)
- isSimilarTo: A pointer to another, functionally similar product (or multiple products). (inherited from Product)
- model: The model of the product. Use with the URL of a ProductModel or a textual representation of the model identifier. The URL of the ProductModel can be from an external source.

- hasMeasurement: A measurement of an item, For example, the inseam of pants, the wheel size of a bicycle, the gauge of a screw, or the carbon footprint measured for certification by an authority. Usually an exact measurement, but can also be a range of measurements for adjustable products, for example belts and ski bindings. (inherited from Product)
- award: An award won by or for this item. (inherited from Product)
- inProductGroupWithID: Indicates the [[productGroupID]] for a [[ProductGroup]] that this product [[isVariantOf]].  (inherited from Product)

- size: A standardized size of a product or creative work, specified either through a simple textual string (for example 'XL', '32Wx34L'), a  QuantitativeValue with a unitCode, or a comprehensive and structured [[SizeSpecification]]; in other cases, the [[width]], [[height]], [[depth]] and [[weight]] properties may be more applicable.  (inherited from Product)
- logo: An associated logo. (inherited from Product)
- asin: An Amazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN) is a 10-character alphanumeric unique identifier assigned by Amazon.com and its partners for product identification within the Amazon organization (summary from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Standard_Identification_Number)'s article).

Note also that this is a definition for how to include ASINs in Schema.org data, and not a definition of ASINs in general - see documentation from Amazon for authoritative details.
ASINs are most commonly encoded as text strings, but the [asin] property supports URL/URI as potential values too. (inherited from Product)
- gtin13: The GTIN-13 code of the product, or the product to which the offer refers. This is equivalent to 13-digit ISBN codes and EAN UCC-13. Former 12-digit UPC codes can be converted into a GTIN-13 code by simply adding a preceding zero. See [GS1 GTIN Summary](http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/idkeys/gtin) for more details. (inherited from Product)
- hasAdultConsideration: Used to tag an item to be intended or suitable for consumption or use by adults only. (inherited from Product)
- positiveNotes: Provides positive considerations regarding something, for example product highlights or (alongside [[negativeNotes]]) pro/con lists for reviews.

In the case of a [[Review]], the property describes the [[itemReviewed]] from the perspective of the review; in the case of a [[Product]], the product itself is being described.

The property values can be expressed either as unstructured text (repeated as necessary), or if ordered, as a list (in which case the most positive is at the beginning of the list). (inherited from Product)
- mpn: The Manufacturer Part Number (MPN) of the product, or the product to which the offer refers. (inherited from Product)
- pattern: A pattern that something has, for example 'polka dot', 'striped', 'Canadian flag'. Values are typically expressed as text, although links to controlled value schemes are also supported. (inherited from Product)

- hasGS1DigitalLink: The <a href="https://www.gs1.org/standards/gs1-digital-link">GS1 digital link</a> associated with the object. This URL should conform to the particular requirements of digital links. The link should only contain the Application Identifiers (AIs) that are relevant for the entity being annotated, for instance a [[Product]] or an [[Organization]], and for the correct granularity. In particular, for products:<ul><li>A Digital Link that contains a serial number (AI <code>21</code>) should only be present on instances of [[IndividualProduct]]</li><li>A Digital Link that contains a lot number (AI <code>10</code>) should be annotated as [[SomeProduct]] if only products from that lot are sold, or [[IndividualProduct]] if there is only a specific product.</li><li>A Digital Link that contains a global model number (AI <code>8013</code>)  should be attached to a [[Product]] or a [[ProductModel]].</li></ul> Other item types should be adapted similarly. (inherited from Product)
- gtin8: The GTIN-8 code of the product, or the product to which the offer refers. This code is also known as EAN/UCC-8 or 8-digit EAN. See [GS1 GTIN Summary](http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/idkeys/gtin) for more details. (inherited from Product)
- reviews: Review of the item. (inherited from Product)
- gtin: A Global Trade Item Number ([GTIN](https://www.gs1.org/standards/id-keys/gtin)). GTINs identify trade items, including products and services, using numeric identification codes.

A correct [[gtin]] value should be a valid GTIN, which means that it should be an all-numeric string of either 8, 12, 13 or 14 digits, or a "GS1 Digital Link" URL based on such a string. The numeric component should also have a [valid GS1 check digit](https://www.gs1.org/services/check-digit-calculator) and meet the other rules for valid GTINs. See also [GS1's GTIN Summary](http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/idkeys/gtin) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Trade_Item_Number) for more details. Left-padding of the gtin values is not required or encouraged. The [[gtin]] property generalizes the earlier [[gtin8]], [[gtin12]], [[gtin13]], and [[gtin14]] properties.

The GS1 [digital link specifications](https://www.gs1.org/standards/Digital-Link/) expresses GTINs as URLs (URIs, IRIs, etc.).
Digital Links should be populated into the [[hasGS1DigitalLink]] attribute.

Note also that this is a definition for how to include GTINs in Schema.org data, and not a definition of GTINs in general - see the GS1 documentation for authoritative details. (inherited from Product)
- isRelatedTo: A pointer to another, somehow related product (or multiple products). (inherited from Product)
- review: A review of the item. (inherited from Product)
- color: The color of the product. (inherited from Product)
- countryOfOrigin: The country of origin of something, including products as well as creative  works such as movie and TV content.

In the case of TV and movie, this would be the country of the principle offices of the production company or individual responsible for the movie. For other kinds of [[CreativeWork]] it is difficult to provide fully general guidance, and properties such as [[contentLocation]] and [[locationCreated]] may be more applicable.

In the case of products, the country of origin of the product. The exact interpretation of this may vary by context and product type, and cannot be fully enumerated here. (inherited from Product)
- gtin14: The GTIN-14 code of the product, or the product to which the offer refers. See [GS1 GTIN Summary](http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/idkeys/gtin) for more details. (inherited from Product)
- offers: An offer to provide this item&#x2014;for example, an offer to sell a product, rent the DVD of a movie, perform a service, or give away tickets to an event. Use [[businessFunction]] to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a [[Demand]]. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer.
       (inherited from Product)
- height: The height of the item. (inherited from Product)
- isAccessoryOrSparePartFor: A pointer to another product (or multiple products) for which this product is an accessory or spare part. (inherited from Product)
- itemCondition: A predefined value from OfferItemCondition specifying the condition of the product or service, or the products or services included in the offer. Also used for product return policies to specify the condition of products accepted for returns. (inherited from Product)
- awards: Awards won by or for this item. (inherited from Product)
- width: The width of the item. (inherited from Product)
- isVariantOf: Indicates the kind of product that this is a variant of. In the case of [[ProductModel]], this is a pointer (from a ProductModel) to a base product from which this product is a variant. It is safe to infer that the variant inherits all product features from the base model, unless defined locally. This is not transitive. In the case of a [[ProductGroup]], the group description also serves as a template, representing a set of Products that vary on explicitly defined, specific dimensions only (so it defines both a set of variants, as well as which values distinguish amongst those variants). When used with [[ProductGroup]], this property can apply to any [[Product]] included in the group. (inherited from Product)
- isConsumableFor: A pointer to another product (or multiple products) for which this product is a consumable. (inherited from Product)
- slogan: A slogan or motto associated with the item. (inherited from Product)

- depth: The depth of the item. (inherited from Product)
- colorSwatch: A color swatch image, visualizing the color of a [[Product]]. Should match the textual description specified in the [[color]] property. This can be a URL or a fully described ImageObject. (inherited from Product)
- aggregateRating: The overall rating, based on a collection of reviews or ratings, of the item. (inherited from Product)
- negativeNotes: Provides negative considerations regarding something, most typically in pro/con lists for reviews (alongside [[positiveNotes]]). For symmetry 

In the case of a [[Review]], the property describes the [[itemReviewed]] from the perspective of the review; in the case of a [[Product]], the product itself is being described. Since product descriptions 
tend to emphasise positive claims, it may be relatively unusual to find [[negativeNotes]] used in this way. Nevertheless for the sake of symmetry, [[negativeNotes]] can be used on [[Product]].

The property values can be expressed either as unstructured text (repeated as necessary), or if ordered, as a list (in which case the most negative is at the beginning of the list). (inherited from Product)
- sku: The Stock Keeping Unit (SKU), i.e. a merchant-specific identifier for a product or service, or the product to which the offer refers. (inherited from Product)
- productID: The product identifier, such as ISBN. For example: ``` meta itemprop="productID" content="isbn:123-456-789" ```. (inherited from Product)
- purchaseDate: The date the item, e.g. vehicle, was purchased by the current owner. (inherited from Product)
- audience: An intended audience, i.e. a group for whom something was created. (inherited from Product)
- name: The name of the item. (inherited from Thing)
- disambiguatingDescription: A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation. (inherited from Thing)
- potentialAction: Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role. (inherited from Thing)
- url: URL of the item. (inherited from Thing)
- identifier: The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of [[Thing]], such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See [background notes](/docs/datamodel.html#identifierBg) for more details.
         (inherited from Thing)
- subjectOf: A CreativeWork or Event about this Thing. (inherited from Thing)
- description: A description of the item. (inherited from Thing)
- additionalType: An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the
    use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference. In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org <a href="https://schema.org/docs/styleguide.html">style guide</a>. (inherited from Thing)
- image: An image of the item. This can be a [[URL]] or a fully described [[ImageObject]]. (inherited from Thing)
- sameAs: URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website. (inherited from Thing)
- alternateName: An alias for the item. (inherited from Thing)
- mainEntityOfPage: Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described. See [background notes](/docs/datamodel.html#mainEntityBackground) for details. (inherited from Thing)
