# ItemList

A list of items of any sort&#x2014;for example, Top 10 Movies About Weathermen, or Top 100 Party Songs. Not to be confused with HTML lists, which are often used only for formatting.

## Type Hierarchy

ItemList is a type of Intangible.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from ItemList:

- BreadcrumbList: A BreadcrumbList is an ItemList consisting of a chain of linked Web pages, typically described using at least their URL and their name, and typically ending with the current page.\n\nThe [[position]] property is used to reconstruct the order of the items in a BreadcrumbList. The convention is that a breadcrumb list has an [[itemListOrder]] of [[ItemListOrderAscending]] (lower values listed first), and that the first items in this list correspond to the "top" or beginning of the breadcrumb trail, e.g. with a site or section homepage. The specific values of 'position' are not assigned meaning for a BreadcrumbList, but they should be integers, e.g. beginning with '1' for the first item in the list.
      
- OfferCatalog: An OfferCatalog is an ItemList that contains related Offers and/or further OfferCatalogs that are offeredBy the same provider.

## Properties

ItemList defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from Intangible:

- itemListElement: For itemListElement values, you can use simple strings (e.g. "Peter", "Paul", "Mary"), existing entities, or use ListItem.\n\nText values are best if the elements in the list are plain strings. Existing entities are best for a simple, unordered list of existing things in your data. ListItem is used with ordered lists when you want to provide additional context about the element in that list or when the same item might be in different places in different lists.\n\nNote: The order of elements in your mark-up is not sufficient for indicating the order or elements.  Use ListItem with a 'position' property in such cases.
- itemListOrder: Type of ordering (e.g. Ascending, Descending, Unordered).
- numberOfItems: The number of items in an ItemList. Note that some descriptions might not fully describe all items in a list (e.g., multi-page pagination); in such cases, the numberOfItems would be for the entire list.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface ItemList {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'ItemList'
  itemListElement?: ListItem | Thing | string
  itemListOrder?: ItemListOrderType | string
  numberOfItems?: number
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "ItemList",
  "name": "Example ItemList",
  "description": "An example of the ItemList type",
  "url": "https://example.com/itemlist",
  "identifier": "example-itemlist-1"
}
```

## Notes

- ItemList inherits all properties from Intangible
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
