Existing entities are best for a simple, unordered list of existing things in your data. ListItem is used with ordered lists when you want to provide additional context about the element in that list or when the same item might be in different places in different lists.\n\nNote: The order of elements in your mark-up is not sufficient for indicating the order or elements.  Use ListItem with a 'position' property in such cases.

# ItemList

A list of items of any sort&#x2014;for example, Top 10 Movies About Weathermen, or Top 100 Party Songs. Not to be confused with HTML lists, which are often used only for formatting.

## Type Hierarchy

ItemList is a type of Intangible.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from ItemList:

- BreadcrumbList: A BreadcrumbList is an ItemList consisting of a chain of linked Web pages, typically described using at least their URL and their name, and typically ending with the current page.\n\nThe [[position]] property is used to reconstruct the order of the items in a BreadcrumbList. The convention is that a breadcrumb list has an [[itemListOrder]] of [[ItemListOrderAscending]] (lower values listed first), and that the first items in this list correspond to the "top" or beginning of the breadcrumb trail, e.g. with a site or section homepage. The specific values of 'position' are not assigned meaning for a BreadcrumbList, but they should be integers, e.g. beginning with '1' for the first item in the list.
      
- OfferCatalog: An OfferCatalog is an ItemList that contains related Offers and/or further OfferCatalogs that are offeredBy the same provider.

## Properties

### Direct Properties

- numberOfItems: The number of items in an ItemList. Note that some descriptions might not fully describe all items in a list (e.g., multi-page pagination); in such cases, the numberOfItems would be for the entire list.
- itemListElement: For itemListElement values, you can use simple strings (e.g. "Peter", "Paul", "Mary"), existing entities, or use ListItem.\n\nText values are best if the elements in the list are plain strings. Existing entities are best for a simple, unordered list of existing things in your data. ListItem is used with ordered lists when you want to provide additional context about the element in that list or when the same item might be in different places in different lists.\n\nNote: The order of elements in your mark-up is not sufficient for indicating the order or elements.  Use ListItem with a 'position' property in such cases.
- itemListOrder: Type of ordering (e.g. Ascending, Descending, Unordered).

### Inherited Properties

- name: The name of the item. (inherited from Thing)
- disambiguatingDescription: A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation. (inherited from Thing)
- potentialAction: Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role. (inherited from Thing)
- url: URL of the item. (inherited from Thing)
- identifier: The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of [[Thing]], such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See [background notes](/docs/datamodel.html#identifierBg) for more details.
         (inherited from Thing)
- subjectOf: A CreativeWork or Event about this Thing. (inherited from Thing)
- description: A description of the item. (inherited from Thing)
- additionalType: An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the
    use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference. In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org <a href="https://schema.org/docs/styleguide.html">style guide</a>. (inherited from Thing)
- image: An image of the item. This can be a [[URL]] or a fully described [[ImageObject]]. (inherited from Thing)
- sameAs: URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website. (inherited from Thing)
- alternateName: An alias for the item. (inherited from Thing)
- mainEntityOfPage: Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described. See [background notes](/docs/datamodel.html#mainEntityBackground) for details. (inherited from Thing)

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface ItemList extends Intangible {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'ItemList'
  numberOfItems?: number
  itemListElement?: ListItem | Thing | string
  itemListOrder?: ItemListOrderType | string
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "ItemList",
  "name": "Example ItemList",
  "description": "An example of the ItemList type",
  "url": "https://example.com/itemlist",
  "identifier": "example-itemlist-1"
}
```

## Notes

- ItemList inherits all properties from Intangible
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
