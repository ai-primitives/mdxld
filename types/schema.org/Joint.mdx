## Usage Example

```typescript
interface Joint extends AnatomicalStructure {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'Joint'
  biomechnicalClass?: string
  structuralClass?: string
  functionalClass?: MedicalEntity | string
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "Joint",
  "name": "Example Joint",
  "description": "An example of the Joint type",
  "url": "https://example.com/joint",
  "identifier": "example-joint-1"
}
```

## Notes

- Joint inherits all properties from AnatomicalStructure
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
