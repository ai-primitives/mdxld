## Type Hierarchy

Accommodation is a type of Place.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from Accommodation:

- Apartment: An apartment (in American English) or flat (in British English) is a self-contained housing unit (a type of residential real estate) that occupies only part of a building (source: Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartment">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartment</a>).
- CampingPitch: A [[CampingPitch]] is an individual place for overnight stay in the outdoors, typically being part of a larger camping site, or [[Campground]].\n\n
In British English a campsite, or campground, is an area, usually divided into a number of pitches, where people can camp overnight using tents or camper vans or caravans; this British English use of the word is synonymous with the American English expression campground. In American English the term campsite generally means an area where an individual, family, group, or military unit can pitch a tent or park a camper; a campground may contain many campsites.
(Source: Wikipedia, see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campsite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campsite).)\n\n
See also the dedicated [document on the use of schema.org for marking up hotels and other forms of accommodations](/docs/hotels.html).

- House: A house is a building or structure that has the ability to be occupied for habitation by humans or other creatures (source: Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House</a>).
- Room: A room is a distinguishable space within a structure, usually separated from other spaces by interior walls (source: Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room</a>).
<br /><br />

- Suite: A suite in a hotel or other public accommodation, denotes a class of luxury accommodations, the key feature of which is multiple rooms (source: Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suite_(hotel)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suite_(hotel)</a>).

## Properties

Accommodation defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from Place:

- accommodationCategory: Category of an [[Accommodation]], following real estate conventions, e.g. RESO (see [PropertySubType](https://ddwiki.reso.org/display/DDW17/PropertySubType+Field), and [PropertyType](https://ddwiki.reso.org/display/DDW17/PropertyType+Field) fields  for suggested values).
- floorLevel: The floor level for an [[Accommodation]] in a multi-storey building. Since counting
  systems [vary internationally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storey#Consecutive_number_floor_designations), the local system should be used where possible.
- permittedUsage: Indications regarding the permitted usage of the accommodation.
- yearBuilt: The year an [[Accommodation]] was constructed. This corresponds to the [YearBuilt field in RESO](https://ddwiki.reso.org/display/DDW17/YearBuilt+Field).
