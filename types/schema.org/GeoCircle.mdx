title: GeoCircle
description: A GeoCircle is a GeoShape representing a circular geographic area. As it is a GeoShape
          it provides the simple textual property 'circle', but also allows the combination of postalCode alongside geoRadius.
          The center of the circle can be indicated via the 'geoMidpoint' property, or more approximately using 'address', 'postalCode'.

# GeoCircle

A GeoCircle is a GeoShape representing a circular geographic area. As it is a GeoShape
          it provides the simple textual property 'circle', but also allows the combination of postalCode alongside geoRadius.
          The center of the circle can be indicated via the 'geoMidpoint' property, or more approximately using 'address', 'postalCode'.
       

## Type Hierarchy

GeoCircle is a type of GeoShape.

### Direct Subtypes

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface GeoCircle extends GeoShape {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'GeoCircle'
  geoMidpoint?: GeoCoordinates
  geoRadius?: Distance | number | string
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "GeoCircle",
  "name": "Example GeoCircle",
  "description": "An example of the GeoCircle type",
  "url": "https://example.com/geocircle",
  "identifier": "example-geocircle-1"
}
```

## Notes

- GeoCircle inherits all properties from GeoShape
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
