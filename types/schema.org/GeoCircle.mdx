# GeoCircle

A GeoCircle is a GeoShape representing a circular geographic area. As it is a GeoShape
          it provides the simple textual property 'circle', but also allows the combination of postalCode alongside geoRadius.
          The center of the circle can be indicated via the 'geoMidpoint' property, or more approximately using 'address', 'postalCode'.
       

## Type Hierarchy

GeoCircle is a type of GeoShape.

### Direct Subtypes

No types directly inherit from GeoCircle.

## Properties

GeoCircle defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from GeoShape:

- geoMidpoint: Indicates the GeoCoordinates at the centre of a GeoShape, e.g. GeoCircle.
- geoRadius: Indicates the approximate radius of a GeoCircle (metres unless indicated otherwise via Distance notation).

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface GeoCircle {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'GeoCircle'
  geoMidpoint?: GeoCoordinates
  geoRadius?: Distance | number | string
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "GeoCircle",
  "name": "Example GeoCircle",
  "description": "An example of the GeoCircle type",
  "url": "https://example.com/geocircle",
  "identifier": "example-geocircle-1"
}
```

## Notes

- GeoCircle inherits all properties from GeoShape
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
