properties:
  direct:
    - name: valueMaxLength
      type: number
      description: Specifies the allowed range for number of characters in a literal value.
    - name: valueMinLength
      type: number
      description: Specifies the minimum allowed range for number of characters in a literal value.
    - name: multipleValues
      type: boolean
      description: Whether multiple values are allowed for the property.  Default is false.
    - name: minValue
      type: number
      description: The lower value of some characteristic or property.
    - name: readonlyValue
      type: boolean
      description: Whether or not a property is mutable.  Default is false. Specifying this for a property that also has a value makes it act similar to a "hidden" input in an HTML form.
    - name: maxValue
      type: number
      description: The upper value of some characteristic or property.
    - name: stepValue
      type: number
      description: The stepValue attribute indicates the granularity that is expected (and required) of the value in a PropertyValueSpecification.
    - name: defaultValue
      type: Thing | string
      description: The default value of the input.  For properties that expect a literal, the default is a literal value, for properties that expect an object, it's an ID reference to one of the current values.
    - name: valueName
      type: string
      description: Indicates the name of the PropertyValueSpecification to be used in URL templates and form encoding in a manner analogous to HTML's input@name.
    - name: valuePattern
      type: string
      description: Specifies a regular expression for testing literal values according to the HTML spec.
    - name: valueRequired
      type: boolean
      description: Whether the property must be filled in to complete the action.  Default is false.
  inherited:
    - name: name
      type: string
      description: The name of the item.
      inheritedFrom: Thing
    - name: disambiguatingDescription
      type: string
      description: A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation.
      inheritedFrom: Thing
    - name: potentialAction
      type: Action
      description: Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role.
      inheritedFrom: Thing
    - name: url
      type: string
      description: URL of the item.
      inheritedFrom: Thing
    - name: identifier
      type: PropertyValue | string
      description: The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of [[Thing]], such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See [background notes](/docs/datamodel.html#identifierBg) for more details.
        
      inheritedFrom: Thing
    - name: subjectOf
      type: CreativeWork | Event
      description: A CreativeWork or Event about this Thing.
      inheritedFrom: Thing
    - name: description
      type: string
      description: A description of the item.
      inheritedFrom: Thing
    - name: additionalType
      type: string
      description: An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the
    use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference. In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org <a href="https://schema.org/docs/styleguide.html">style guide</a>.
      inheritedFrom: Thing
    - name: image
      type: ImageObject | string
      description: An image of the item. This can be a [[URL]] or a fully described [[ImageObject]].
      inheritedFrom: Thing
    - name: sameAs
      type: string
      description: URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website.
      inheritedFrom: Thing
    - name: alternateName
      type: string
      description: An alias for the item.
      inheritedFrom: Thing

# PropertyValueSpecification

A Property value specification.

## Type Hierarchy

PropertyValueSpecification is a type of Intangible.

### Direct Subtypes

No types directly inherit from PropertyValueSpecification.

## Properties

### Direct Properties

- valueMaxLength: Specifies the allowed range for number of characters in a literal value.
- valueMinLength: Specifies the minimum allowed range for number of characters in a literal value.
- multipleValues: Whether multiple values are allowed for the property.  Default is false.
- minValue: The lower value of some characteristic or property.
- readonlyValue: Whether or not a property is mutable.  Default is false. Specifying this for a property that also has a value makes it act similar to a "hidden" input in an HTML form.
- maxValue: The upper value of some characteristic or property.
- stepValue: The stepValue attribute indicates the granularity that is expected (and required) of the value in a PropertyValueSpecification.
- defaultValue: The default value of the input.  For properties that expect a literal, the default is a literal value, for properties that expect an object, it's an ID reference to one of the current values.
- valueName: Indicates the name of the PropertyValueSpecification to be used in URL templates and form encoding in a manner analogous to HTML's input@name.
- valuePattern: Specifies a regular expression for testing literal values according to the HTML spec.
- valueRequired: Whether the property must be filled in to complete the action.  Default is false.

### Inherited Properties

- name: The name of the item. (inherited from Thing)
- disambiguatingDescription: A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation. (inherited from Thing)
- potentialAction: Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role. (inherited from Thing)
- url: URL of the item. (inherited from Thing)
- identifier: The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of [[Thing]], such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See [background notes](/docs/datamodel.html#identifierBg) for more details.
         (inherited from Thing)
- subjectOf: A CreativeWork or Event about this Thing. (inherited from Thing)
- description: A description of the item. (inherited from Thing)
- additionalType: An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the
    use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference.

- image: An image of the item. This can be a [[URL]] or a fully described [[ImageObject]]. (inherited from Thing)
- sameAs: URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website. (inherited from Thing)
- alternateName: An alias for the item. (inherited from Thing)
- mainEntityOfPage: Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described. See [background notes](/docs/datamodel.html#mainEntityBackground) for details. (inherited from Thing)

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface PropertyValueSpecification extends Intangible {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'PropertyValueSpecification'
  valueMaxLength?: number
  valueMinLength?: number
  multipleValues?: boolean
  minValue?: number
  readonlyValue?: boolean
  maxValue?: number
  stepValue?: number
  defaultValue?: Thing | string
  valueName?: string
  valuePattern?: string
  valueRequired?: boolean
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "PropertyValueSpecification",
  "name": "Example PropertyValueSpecification",
  "description": "An example of the PropertyValueSpecification type",
  "url": "https://example.com/propertyvaluespecification",
  "identifier": "example-propertyvaluespecification-1"
}
```

## Notes

- PropertyValueSpecification inherits all properties from Intangible
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
