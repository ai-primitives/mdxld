# QualitativeValue

A predefined value for a product characteristic, e.g. the power cord plug type 'US' or the garment sizes 'S', 'M', 'L', and 'XL'.

## Type Hierarchy

QualitativeValue is a type of Enumeration.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from QualitativeValue:

- BedType: A type of bed. This is used for indicating the bed or beds available in an accommodation.
- DriveWheelConfigurationValue: A value indicating which roadwheels will receive torque.
- SizeSpecification: Size related properties of a product, typically a size code ([[name]]) and optionally a [[sizeSystem]], [[sizeGroup]], and product measurements ([[hasMeasurement]]). In addition, the intended audience can be defined through [[suggestedAge]], [[suggestedGender]], and suggested body measurements ([[suggestedMeasurement]]).
- SteeringPositionValue: A value indicating a steering position.

## Properties

### Direct Properties

- equal: This ordering relation for qualitative values indicates that the subject is equal to the object.
- additionalProperty: A property-value pair representing an additional characteristic of the entity, e.g. a product feature or another characteristic for which there is no matching property in schema.org.\n\nNote: Publishers should be aware that applications designed to use specific schema.org properties (e.g. https://schema.org/width, https://schema.org/color, https://schema.org/gtin13, ...) will typically expect such data to be provided using those properties, rather than using the generic property/value mechanism.

- lesser: This ordering relation for qualitative values indicates that the subject is lesser than the object.
- lesserOrEqual: This ordering relation for qualitative values indicates that the subject is lesser than or equal to the object.
- greaterOrEqual: This ordering relation for qualitative values indicates that the subject is greater than or equal to the object.
- greater: This ordering relation for qualitative values indicates that the subject is greater than the object.
- nonEqual: This ordering relation for qualitative values indicates that the subject is not equal to the object.
- valueReference: A secondary value that provides additional information on the original value, e.g. a reference temperature or a type of measurement.

### Inherited Properties

- supersededBy: Relates a term (i.e. a property, class or enumeration) to one that supersedes it. (inherited from Enumeration)
- name: The name of the item. (inherited from Thing)
- disambiguatingDescription: A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation. (inherited from Thing)
- potentialAction: Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role. (inherited from Thing)
- url: URL of the item. (inherited from Thing)
- identifier: The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of [[Thing]], such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See [background notes](/docs/datamodel.html#identifierBg) for more details.
         (inherited from Thing)
- subjectOf: A CreativeWork or Event about this Thing. (inherited from Thing)
- description: A description of the item. (inherited from Thing)
- additionalType: An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the
    use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface QualitativeValue extends Enumeration {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'QualitativeValue'
  equal?: QualitativeValue
  additionalProperty?: PropertyValue
  lesser?: QualitativeValue
  lesserOrEqual?: QualitativeValue
  greaterOrEqual?: QualitativeValue
  greater?: QualitativeValue
  nonEqual?: QualitativeValue
  valueReference?: DefinedTerm | Enumeration | MeasurementTypeEnumeration | PropertyValue | QualitativeValue | QuantitativeValue | StructuredValue | string
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "QualitativeValue",
  "name": "Example QualitativeValue",
  "description": "An example of the QualitativeValue type",
  "url": "https://example.com/qualitativevalue",
  "identifier": "example-qualitativevalue-1"
}
```

## Notes

- QualitativeValue inherits all properties from Enumeration
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
