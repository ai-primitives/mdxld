# QualitativeValue

A predefined value for a product characteristic, e.g. the power cord plug type 'US' or the garment sizes 'S', 'M', 'L', and 'XL'.

## Type Hierarchy

QualitativeValue is a type of Enumeration.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from QualitativeValue:

- BedType: A type of bed. This is used for indicating the bed or beds available in an accommodation.
- DriveWheelConfigurationValue: A value indicating which roadwheels will receive torque.
- SizeSpecification: Size related properties of a product, typically a size code ([[name]]) and optionally a [[sizeSystem]], [[sizeGroup]], and product measurements ([[hasMeasurement]]). In addition, the intended audience can be defined through [[suggestedAge]], [[suggestedGender]], and suggested body measurements ([[suggestedMeasurement]]).
- SteeringPositionValue: A value indicating a steering position.

## Properties

QualitativeValue defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from Enumeration:

- equal: This ordering relation for qualitative values indicates that the subject is equal to the object.
- greater: This ordering relation for qualitative values indicates that the subject is greater than the object.
- greaterOrEqual: This ordering relation for qualitative values indicates that the subject is greater than or equal to the object.
- lesser: This ordering relation for qualitative values indicates that the subject is lesser than the object.
- lesserOrEqual: This ordering relation for qualitative values indicates that the subject is lesser than or equal to the object.
- nonEqual: This ordering relation for qualitative values indicates that the subject is not equal to the object.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface QualitativeValue {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'QualitativeValue'
  equal?: QualitativeValue
  greater?: QualitativeValue
  greaterOrEqual?: QualitativeValue
  lesser?: QualitativeValue
  lesserOrEqual?: QualitativeValue
  nonEqual?: QualitativeValue
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "QualitativeValue",
  "name": "Example QualitativeValue",
  "description": "An example of the QualitativeValue type",
  "url": "https://example.com/qualitativevalue",
  "identifier": "example-qualitativevalue-1"
}
```

## Notes

- QualitativeValue inherits all properties from Enumeration
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
