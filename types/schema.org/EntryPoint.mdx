## Usage Example

```typescript
interface EntryPoint extends Intangible {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'EntryPoint'
  actionPlatform?: DigitalPlatformEnumeration | string
  contentType?: string
  actionApplication?: SoftwareApplication
  encodingType?: string
  urlTemplate?: string
  httpMethod?: string
  application?: SoftwareApplication
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "EntryPoint",
  "name": "Example EntryPoint",
  "description": "An example of the EntryPoint type",
  "url": "https://example.com/entrypoint",
  "identifier": "example-entrypoint-1"
}
```

## Notes

- EntryPoint inherits all properties from Intangible
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
