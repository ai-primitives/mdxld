## Usage Example

```typescript
interface InfectiousDisease extends MedicalCondition {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'InfectiousDisease'
  infectiousAgentClass?: InfectiousAgentClass
  transmissionMethod?: string
  infectiousAgent?: string
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "InfectiousDisease",

  "description": "An example of the InfectiousDisease type",
  "url": "https://example.com/infectiousdisease",
  "identifier": "example-infectiousdisease-1"
}
```

## Notes

- InfectiousDisease inherits all properties from MedicalCondition
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
