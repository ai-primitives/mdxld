# MathSolver

A math solver which is capable of solving a subset of mathematical problems.

## Type Hierarchy

MathSolver is a type of CreativeWork.

### Direct Subtypes

No types directly inherit from MathSolver.

## Properties

MathSolver defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from CreativeWork:

- mathExpression: A mathematical expression (e.g. 'x^2-3x=0') that may be solved for a specific variable, simplified, or transformed. This can take many formats, e.g. LaTeX, Ascii-Math, or math as you would write with a keyboard.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface MathSolver {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'MathSolver'
  mathExpression?: SolveMathAction | string
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "MathSolver",
  "name": "Example MathSolver",
  "description": "An example of the MathSolver type",
  "url": "https://example.com/mathsolver",
  "identifier": "example-mathsolver-1"
}
```

## Notes

- MathSolver inherits all properties from CreativeWork
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
