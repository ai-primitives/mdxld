# Role

Represents additional information about a relationship or property. For example a Role can be used to say that a 'member' role linking some SportsTeam to a player occurred during a particular time period. Or that a Person's 'actor' role in a Movie was for some particular characterName. Such properties can be attached to a Role entity, which is then associated with the main entities using ordinary properties like 'member' or 'actor'.\n\nSee also [blog post](http://blog.schema.org/2014/06/introducing-role.html).

## Type Hierarchy

Role is a type of Intangible.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from Role:

- LinkRole: A Role that represents a Web link, e.g. as expressed via the 'url' property. Its linkRelationship property can indicate URL-based and plain textual link types, e.g. those in IANA link registry or others such as 'amphtml'. This structure provides a placeholder where details from HTML's link element can be represented outside of HTML, e.g. in JSON-LD feeds.
- OrganizationRole: A subclass of Role used to describe roles within organizations.
- PerformanceRole: A PerformanceRole is a Role that some entity places with regard to a theatrical performance, e.g. in a Movie, TVSeries etc.

## Properties

Role defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from Intangible:

- namedPosition: A position played, performed or filled by a person or organization, as part of an organization. For example, an athlete in a SportsTeam might play in the position named 'Quarterback'.
- roleName: A role played, performed or filled by a person or organization. For example, the team of creators for a comic book might fill the roles named 'inker', 'penciller', and 'letterer'; or an athlete in a SportsTeam might play in the position named 'Quarterback'.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface Role {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'Role'
  namedPosition?: string
  roleName?: string
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "Role",
  "name": "Example Role",
  "description": "An example of the Role type",
  "url": "https://example.com/role",
  "identifier": "example-role-1"
}
```

## Notes

- Role inherits all properties from Intangible
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
