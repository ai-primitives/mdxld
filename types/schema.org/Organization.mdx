# Organization

An organization such as a school, NGO, corporation, club, etc.

## Type Hierarchy

Organization is a type of Thing.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from Organization:

- Airline: An organization that provides flights for passengers.
- Consortium: A Consortium is a membership [[Organization]] whose members are typically Organizations.
- Corporation: Organization: A business corporation.
- FundingScheme: A FundingScheme combines organizational, project and policy aspects of grant-based funding
    that sets guidelines, principles and mechanisms to support other kinds of projects and activities.
    Funding is typically organized via [[Grant]] funding. Examples of funding schemes: Swiss Priority Programmes (SPPs); EU Framework 7 (FP7); Horizon 2020; the NIH-R01 Grant Program; Wellcome institutional strategic support fund. For large scale public sector funding, the management and administration of grant awards is often handled by other, dedicated, organizations - [[FundingAgency]]s such as ERC, REA, ...

- LibrarySystem: A [[LibrarySystem]] is a collaborative system amongst several libraries.
- MedicalOrganization: A medical organization (physical or not), such as hospital, institution or clinic.
- NewsMediaOrganization: A News/Media organization such as a newspaper or TV station.
- NGO: Organization: Non-governmental Organization.
- OnlineBusiness: A particular online business, either standalone or the online part of a broader organization. Examples include an eCommerce site, an online travel booking site, an online learning site, an online logistics and shipping provider, an online (virtual) doctor, etc.
- PerformingGroup: A performance group, such as a band, an orchestra, or a circus.
- PoliticalParty: Organization: Political Party.
- Project: An enterprise (potentially individual but typically collaborative), planned to achieve a particular aim.
Use properties from [[Organization]], [[subOrganization]]/[[parentOrganization]] to indicate project sub-structures. 
   
- ResearchOrganization: A Research Organization (e.g. scientific institute, research company).
- SearchRescueOrganization: A Search and Rescue organization of some kind.
- SportsOrganization: Represents the collection of all sports organizations, including sports teams, governing bodies, and sports associations.
- WorkersUnion: A Workers Union (also known as a Labor Union, Labour Union, or Trade Union) is an organization that promotes the interests of its worker members by collectively bargaining with management, organizing, and political lobbying.

## Properties

Organization defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from Thing:

- department: A relationship between an organization and a department of that organization, also described as an organization (allowing different urls, logos, opening hours). For example: a store with a pharmacy, or a bakery with a cafe.
- dissolutionDate: The date that this organization was dissolved.
- employee: Someone working for this organization.
- employees: People working for this organization.
- founder: A person or organization who founded this organization.
- founders: A person who founded this organization.
- foundingDate: The date that this organization was founded.
- foundingLocation: The place where the Organization was founded.
- hasMemberProgram: MemberProgram offered by an Organization, for example an eCommerce merchant or an airline.
- iso6523Code: An organization identifier as defined in [ISO 6523(-1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_6523). The identifier should be in the `XXXX:YYYYYY:ZZZ` or `XXXX:YYYYYY`format. Where `XXXX` is a 4 digit _ICD_ (International Code Designator), `YYYYYY` is an _OID_ (Organization Identifier) with all formatting characters (dots, dashes, spaces) removed with a maximal length of 35 characters, and `ZZZ` is an optional OPI (Organization Part Identifier) with a maximum length of 35 characters. The various components (ICD, OID, OPI) are joined with a colon character (ASCII `0x3a`). Note that many existing organization identifiers defined as attributes like [leiCode](https://schema.org/leiCode) (`0199`), [duns](https://schema.org/duns) (`0060`) or [GLN](https://schema.org/globalLocationNumber) (`0088`) can be expressed using ISO-6523. If possible, ISO-6523 codes should be preferred to populating [vatID](https://schema.org/vatID) or [taxID](https://schema.org/taxID), as ISO identifiers are less ambiguous.
- legalName: The official name of the organization, e.g. the registered company name.
- leiCode: An organization identifier that uniquely identifies a legal entity as defined in ISO 17442.
- nonprofitStatus: nonprofitStatus indicates the legal status of a non-profit organization in its primary place of business.
- parentOrganization: The larger organization that this organization is a [[subOrganization]] of, if any.
- subOrganization: A relationship between two organizations where the first includes the second, e.g., as a subsidiary. See also: the more specific 'department' property.
