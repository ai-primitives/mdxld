# Nerve

A common pathway for the electrochemical nerve impulses that are transmitted along each of the axons.

## Type Hierarchy

Nerve is a type of AnatomicalStructure.

### Direct Subtypes

No types directly inherit from Nerve.

## Properties

Nerve defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from AnatomicalStructure:

- branch: The branches that delineate from the nerve bundle. Not to be confused with [[branchOf]].
- nerveMotor: The neurological pathway extension that involves muscle control.
- sensoryUnit: The neurological pathway extension that inputs and sends information to the brain or spinal cord.
- sourcedFrom: The neurological pathway that originates the neurons.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface Nerve {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'Nerve'
  branch?: AnatomicalStructure
  nerveMotor?: Muscle
  sensoryUnit?: AnatomicalStructure | SuperficialAnatomy
  sourcedFrom?: BrainStructure
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "Nerve",
  "name": "Example Nerve",
  "description": "An example of the Nerve type",
  "url": "https://example.com/nerve",
  "identifier": "example-nerve-1"
}
```

## Notes

- Nerve inherits all properties from AnatomicalStructure
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
