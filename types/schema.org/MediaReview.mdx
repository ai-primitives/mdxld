# MediaReview

    For more general reviews of media in the broader sense, use [[UserReview]], [[CriticReview]] or other [[Review]] types. This definition is
    a work in progress. While the [[MediaManipulationRatingEnumeration]] list reflects significant community review amongst fact-checkers and others working
    to combat misinformation, the specific structures for representing media objects, their versions and publication context, are still evolving. Similarly, best practices for the relationship between [[MediaReview]] and [[ClaimReview]] markup have not yet been finalized.
