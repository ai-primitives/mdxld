## Usage Example

```typescript
interface ShippingRateSettings extends StructuredValue {
  $context?: 'schema.org'

  freeShippingThreshold?: DeliveryChargeSpecification | MonetaryAmount
  shippingRate?: MonetaryAmount
  shippingDestination?: DefinedRegion
  isUnlabelledFallback?: boolean
  doesNotShip?: boolean
  shippingLabel?: string
}
```

## Example Usage
