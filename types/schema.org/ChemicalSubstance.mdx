# ChemicalSubstance

A chemical substance is 'a portion of matter of constant composition, composed of molecular entities of the same type or of different types' (source: [ChEBI:59999](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=59999)).

## Type Hierarchy

ChemicalSubstance is a type of BioChemEntity.

### Direct Subtypes

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface ChemicalSubstance extends BioChemEntity {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'ChemicalSubstance'
  potentialUse?: DefinedTerm
  chemicalRole?: DefinedTerm
  chemicalComposition?: string
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "ChemicalSubstance",
  "name": "Example ChemicalSubstance",
  "description": "An example of the ChemicalSubstance type",
  "url": "https://example.com/chemicalsubstance",
  "identifier": "example-chemicalsubstance-1"
}
```

## Notes

- ChemicalSubstance inherits all properties from BioChemEntity
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
