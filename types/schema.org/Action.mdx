# Action

An action performed by a direct agent and indirect participants upon a direct object. Optionally happens at a location with the help of an inanimate instrument. The execution of the action may produce a result. Specific action sub-type documentation specifies the exact expectation of each argument/role.\n\nSee also [blog post](http://blog.schema.org/2014/04/announcing-schemaorg-actions.html) and [Actions overview document](https://schema.org/docs/actions.html).

## Type Hierarchy

Action is a type of Thing.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from Action:

- AchieveAction: The act of accomplishing something via previous efforts. It is an instantaneous action rather than an ongoing process.
- AssessAction: The act of forming one's opinion, reaction or sentiment.
- ConsumeAction: The act of ingesting information/resources/food.
- ControlAction: An agent controls a device or application.
- CreateAction: The act of deliberately creating/producing/generating/building a result out of the agent.
- FindAction: The act of finding an object.\n\nRelated actions:\n\n* [[SearchAction]]: FindAction is generally lead by a SearchAction, but not necessarily.
- InteractAction: The act of interacting with another person or organization.
- MoveAction: The act of an agent relocating to a place.\n\nRelated actions:\n\n* [[TransferAction]]: Unlike TransferAction, the subject of the move is a living Person or Organization rather than an inanimate object.
- OrganizeAction: The act of manipulating/administering/supervising/controlling one or more objects.
- PlayAction: The act of playing/exercising/training/performing for enjoyment, leisure, recreation, competition or exercise.\n\nRelated actions:\n\n* [[ListenAction]]: Unlike ListenAction (which is under ConsumeAction), PlayAction refers to performing for an audience or at an event, rather than consuming music.\n* [[WatchAction]]: Unlike WatchAction (which is under ConsumeAction), PlayAction refers to showing/displaying for an audience or at an event, rather than consuming visual content.
- SearchAction: The act of searching for an object.\n\nRelated actions:\n\n* [[FindAction]]: SearchAction generally leads to a FindAction, but not necessarily.
- SeekToAction: This is the [[Action]] of navigating to a specific [[startOffset]] timestamp within a [[VideoObject]], typically represented with a URL template structure.
- SolveMathAction: The action that takes in a math expression and directs users to a page potentially capable of solving/simplifying that expression.
- TradeAction: The act of participating in an exchange of goods and services for monetary compensation. An agent trades an object, product or service with a participant in exchange for a one time or periodic payment.
- TransferAction: The act of transferring/moving (abstract or concrete) animate or inanimate objects from one place to another.
- UpdateAction: The act of managing by changing/editing the state of the object.

### Inherited Properties

- name: The name of the item. (inherited from Thing)

- potentialAction: Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role. (inherited from Thing)
- url: URL of the item. (inherited from Thing)
- identifier: The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of [[Thing]], such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links.

- subjectOf: A CreativeWork or Event about this Thing. (inherited from Thing)
- description: A description of the item. (inherited from Thing)
- additionalType: An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the
    use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface Action extends Thing {

  $type: 'Action'
  actionProcess?: HowTo
  result?: Thing
  endTime?: string
  agent?: Organization | Person
  error?: Thing
  location?: Place | PostalAddress | VirtualLocation | string
  actionStatus?: ActionStatusType
  startTime?: string
  target?: EntryPoint | string
  participant?: Organization | Person
  instrument?: Thing
  provider?: Organization | Person
  object?: Thing
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "Action",

  "description": "An example of the Action type",
  "url": "https://example.com/action",
  "identifier": "example-action-1"
}
```

## Notes

- Action inherits all properties from Thing
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
