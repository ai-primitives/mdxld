description: A structured value providing information about the opening hours of a place or a certain service inside a place.\n\n
The place is __open__ if the [[opens]] property is specified, and __closed__ otherwise.\n\nIf the value for the [[closes]] property is less than the value for the [[opens]] property then the hour range is assumed to span over the next day.
