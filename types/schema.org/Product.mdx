# Product

Any offered product or service. For example: a pair of shoes; a concert ticket; the rental of a car; a haircut; or an episode of a TV show streamed online.

## Type Hierarchy

Product is a type of Thing.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from Product:

- IndividualProduct: A single, identifiable product instance (e.g. a laptop with a particular serial number).
- ProductGroup: A ProductGroup represents a group of [[Product]]s that vary only in certain well-described ways, such as by [[size]], [[color]], [[material]] etc.

While a ProductGroup itself is not directly offered for sale, the various varying products that it represents can be. The ProductGroup serves as a prototype or template, standing in for all of the products who have an [[isVariantOf]] relationship to it. As such, properties (including additional types) can be applied to the ProductGroup to represent characteristics shared by each of the (possibly very many) variants. Properties that reference a ProductGroup are not included in this mechanism; neither are the following specific properties [[variesBy]], [[hasVariant]], [[url]]. 
- ProductModel: A datasheet or vendor specification of a product (in the sense of a prototypical description).
- SomeProducts: A placeholder for multiple similar products of the same kind.
- Vehicle: A vehicle is a device that is designed or used to transport people or cargo over land, water, air, or through space.

## Properties

Product defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from Thing:

- color: The color of the product.
- colorSwatch: A color swatch image, visualizing the color of a [[Product]]. Should match the textual description specified in the [[color]] property. This can be a URL or a fully described ImageObject.
- countryOfAssembly: The place where the product was assembled.
- countryOfLastProcessing: The place where the item (typically [[Product]]) was last processed and tested before importation.
- hasEnergyConsumptionDetails: Defines the energy efficiency Category (also known as "class" or "rating") for a product according to an international energy efficiency standard.
- inProductGroupWithID: Indicates the [[productGroupID]] for a [[ProductGroup]] that this product [[isVariantOf]]. 
- isAccessoryOrSparePartFor: A pointer to another product (or multiple products) for which this product is an accessory or spare part.
- isConsumableFor: A pointer to another product (or multiple products) for which this product is a consumable.
- manufacturer: The manufacturer of the product.
- model: The model of the product. Use with the URL of a ProductModel or a textual representation of the model identifier. The URL of the ProductModel can be from an external source. It is recommended to additionally provide strong product identifiers via the gtin8/gtin13/gtin14 and mpn properties.
- nsn: Indicates the [NATO stock number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_Stock_Number) (nsn) of a [[Product]]. 
- productID: The product identifier, such as ISBN. For example: ``` meta itemprop="productID" content="isbn:123-456-789" ```.
- releaseDate: The release date of a product or product model. This can be used to distinguish the exact variant of a product.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface Product {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'Product'
  color?: string
  colorSwatch?: ImageObject | string
  countryOfAssembly?: string
  countryOfLastProcessing?: string
  hasEnergyConsumptionDetails?: EnergyConsumptionDetails
  inProductGroupWithID?: string
  isAccessoryOrSparePartFor?: Product
  isConsumableFor?: Product
  manufacturer?: Organization
  model?: ProductModel | string
  nsn?: string
  productID?: string
  releaseDate?: string
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "Product",
  "name": "Example Product",
  "description": "An example of the Product type",
  "url": "https://example.com/product",
  "identifier": "example-product-1"
}
```

## Notes

- Product inherits all properties from Thing
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
