title: SizeSpecification
description: Size related properties of a product, typically a size code ([[name]]) and optionally a [[sizeSystem]], [[sizeGroup]], and product measurements ([[hasMeasurement]]). In addition, the intended audience can be defined through [[suggestedAge]], [[suggestedGender]], and suggested body measurements ([[suggestedMeasurement]]).

# SizeSpecification

Size related properties of a product, typically a size code ([[name]]) and optionally a [[sizeSystem]], [[sizeGroup]], and product measurements ([[hasMeasurement]]). In addition, the intended audience can be defined through [[suggestedAge]], [[suggestedGender]], and suggested body measurements ([[suggestedMeasurement]]).

## Type Hierarchy

SizeSpecification is a type of QualitativeValue.

### Direct Subtypes

No types directly inherit from SizeSpecification.

## Properties

### Direct Properties

- hasMeasurement: A measurement of an item, For example, the inseam of pants, the wheel size of a bicycle, the gauge of a screw, or the carbon footprint measured for certification by an authority. Usually an exact measurement, but can also be a range of measurements for adjustable products, for example belts and ski bindings.
- suggestedAge: The age or age range for the intended audience or person, for example 3-12 months for infants, 1-5 years for toddlers.
- suggestedGender: The suggested gender of the intended person or audience, for example "male", "female", or "unisex".
- suggestedMeasurement: A suggested range of body measurements for the intended audience or person, for example inseam between 32 and 34 inches or height between 170 and 190 cm. Typically found on a size chart for wearable products.
- sizeGroup: The size group (also known as "size type") for a product's size. Size groups are common in the fashion industry to define size segments and suggested audiences for wearable products. Multiple values can be combined, for example "men's big and tall", "petite maternity" or "regular".
- sizeSystem: The size system used to identify a product's size. Typically either a standard (for example, "GS1" or "ISO-EN13402"), country code (for example "US" or "JP"), or a measuring system (for example "Metric" or "Imperial").

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface SizeSpecification extends QualitativeValue {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'SizeSpecification'
  hasMeasurement?: QuantitativeValue
  suggestedAge?: QuantitativeValue
  suggestedGender?: GenderType | string
  suggestedMeasurement?: QuantitativeValue
  sizeGroup?: SizeGroupEnumeration | string
  sizeSystem?: SizeSystemEnumeration | string
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "SizeSpecification",
  "name": "Example SizeSpecification",
  "description": "An example of the SizeSpecification type",
  "url": "https://example.com/sizespecification",
  "identifier": "example-sizespecification-1"
}
```

## Notes

- SizeSpecification inherits all properties from QualitativeValue
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
