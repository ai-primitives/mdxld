# ProductGroup

A ProductGroup represents a group of [[Product]]s that vary only in certain well-described ways, such as by [[size]], [[color]], [[material]] etc.

While a ProductGroup itself is not directly offered for sale, the various varying products that it represents can be. The ProductGroup serves as a prototype or template, standing in for all of the products who have an [[isVariantOf]] relationship to it. As such, properties (including additional types) can be applied to the ProductGroup to represent characteristics shared by each of the (possibly very many) variants. Properties that reference a ProductGroup are not included in this mechanism; neither are the following specific properties [[variesBy]], [[hasVariant]], [[url]]. 

## Type Hierarchy

ProductGroup is a type of Product.

### Direct Subtypes

No types directly inherit from ProductGroup.

## Properties

ProductGroup defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from Product:

- hasVariant: Indicates a [[Product]] that is a member of this [[ProductGroup]] (or [[ProductModel]]).
- productGroupID: Indicates a textual identifier for a ProductGroup.
- variesBy: Indicates the property or properties by which the variants in a [[ProductGroup]] vary, e.g. their size, color etc. Schema.org properties can be referenced by their short name e.g. "color"; terms defined elsewhere can be referenced with their URIs.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface ProductGroup {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'ProductGroup'
  hasVariant?: Product
  productGroupID?: string
  variesBy?: DefinedTerm | string
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "ProductGroup",
  "name": "Example ProductGroup",
  "description": "An example of the ProductGroup type",
  "url": "https://example.com/productgroup",
  "identifier": "example-productgroup-1"
}
```

## Notes

- ProductGroup inherits all properties from Product
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
