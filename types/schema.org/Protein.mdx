title: Protein
description: Protein is here used in its widest possible definition, as classes of amino acid based molecules. Amyloid-beta Protein in human (UniProt P05067), eukaryota (e.g. an OrthoDB group) or even a single molecule that one can point to are all of type :Protein. A protein can thus be a subclass of another protein, e.g. :Protein as a UniProt record can have multiple isoforms inside it which would also be :Protein. They can be imagined, synthetic, hypothetical or naturally occurring.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface Protein extends BioChemEntity {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'Protein'
  hasBioPolymerSequence?: string
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "Protein",
  "name": "Example Protein",
  "description": "An example of the Protein type",
  "url": "https://example.com/protein",
  "identifier": "example-protein-1"
}
```

## Notes

- Protein inherits all properties from BioChemEntity
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
