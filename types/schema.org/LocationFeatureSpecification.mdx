a URL indicating the type of the property, either pointing to an external vocabulary, or a Web resource that describes the property (e.g. a glossary entry).
Standards bodies should promote a standard prefix for the identifiers of properties from their standards.

      type: DefinedTerm | MeasurementMethodEnum | string
      description: A technique, method or technology used in an [[Observation]], [[StatisticalVariable]] or [[Dataset]] (or [[DataDownload]], [[DataCatalog]]), corresponding to the method used for measuring the corresponding variable(s) (for datasets, described using [[variableMeasured]]; for [[Observation]], a [[StatisticalVariable]]). Often but not necessarily each [[variableMeasured]] will have an explicit representation as (or mapping to) an property such as those defined in Schema.org, or other RDF vocabularies and "knowledge graphs". In that case the subproperty of [[variableMeasured]] called [[measuredProperty]] is applicable.
    
The [[measurementTechnique]] property helps when extra clarification is needed about how a [[measuredProperty]] was measured. This is oriented towards scientific and scholarly dataset publication but may have broader applicability; it is not intended as a full representation of measurement, but can often serve as a high level summary for dataset discovery. 

For example, if [[variableMeasured]] is: molecule concentration, [[measurementTechnique]] could be: "mass spectrometry" or "nmr spectroscopy" or "colorimetry" or "immunofluorescence". If the [[variableMeasured]] is "depression rating", the [[measurementTechnique]] could be "Zung Scale" or "HAM-D" or "Beck Depression Inventory". 

If there are several [[variableMeasured]] properties recorded for some given data object, use a [[PropertyValue]] for each [[variableMeasured]] and attach the corresponding [[measurementTechnique]]. The value can also be from an enumeration, organized as a [[MeasurementMetholdEnumeration]].

# LocationFeatureSpecification

Specifies a location feature by providing a structured value representing a feature of an accommodation as a property-value pair of varying degrees of formality.

## Type Hierarchy

LocationFeatureSpecification is a type of PropertyValue.

### Direct Subtypes

No types directly inherit from LocationFeatureSpecification.

## Properties

### Direct Properties

- validThrough: The date after when the item is not valid. For example the end of an offer, salary period, or a period of opening hours.
- hoursAvailable: The hours during which this service or contact is available.
- validFrom: The date when the item becomes valid.

### Inherited Properties

- minValue: The lower value of some characteristic or property. (inherited from PropertyValue)
- propertyID: A commonly used identifier for the characteristic represented by the property, e.g. a manufacturer or a standard code for a property. propertyID can be

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface LocationFeatureSpecification extends PropertyValue {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'LocationFeatureSpecification'
  validThrough?: string
  hoursAvailable?: OpeningHoursSpecification
  validFrom?: string
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "LocationFeatureSpecification",
  "name": "Example LocationFeatureSpecification",
  "description": "An example of the LocationFeatureSpecification type",
  "url": "https://example.com/locationfeaturespecification",
  "identifier": "example-locationfeaturespecification-1"
}
```

## Notes

- LocationFeatureSpecification inherits all properties from PropertyValue
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
