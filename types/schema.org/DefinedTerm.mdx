# DefinedTerm

A word, name, acronym, phrase, etc. with a formal definition. Often used in the context of category or subject classification, glossaries or dictionaries, product or creative work types, etc. Use the name property for the term being defined, use termCode if the term has an alpha-numeric code allocated, use description to provide the definition of the term.

## Type Hierarchy

DefinedTerm is a type of Intangible.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from DefinedTerm:

- CategoryCode: A Category Code.

## Properties

### Direct Properties

- inDefinedTermSet: A [[DefinedTermSet]] that contains this term.
- termCode: A code that identifies this [[DefinedTerm]] within a [[DefinedTermSet]].

### Inherited Properties

- name: The name of the item. (inherited from Thing)
- disambiguatingDescription: A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation. (inherited from Thing)

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface DefinedTerm extends Intangible {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'DefinedTerm'
  inDefinedTermSet?: DefinedTermSet | string
  termCode?: string
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "DefinedTerm",
  "name": "Example DefinedTerm",
  "description": "An example of the DefinedTerm type",
  "url": "https://example.com/definedterm",
  "identifier": "example-definedterm-1"
}
```

## Notes

- DefinedTerm inherits all properties from Intangible
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
