# EngineSpecification

Information about the engine of the vehicle. A vehicle can have multiple engines represented by multiple engine specification entities.

## Type Hierarchy

EngineSpecification is a type of StructuredValue.

### Direct Subtypes

No types directly inherit from EngineSpecification.

## Properties

EngineSpecification defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from StructuredValue:

- engineDisplacement: The volume swept by all of the pistons inside the cylinders of an internal combustion engine in a single movement. \n\nTypical unit code(s): CMQ for cubic centimeter, LTR for liters, INQ for cubic inches\n* Note 1: You can link to information about how the given value has been determined using the [[valueReference]] property.\n* Note 2: You can use [[minValue]] and [[maxValue]] to indicate ranges.
- enginePower: The power of the vehicle's engine.
    Typical unit code(s): KWT for kilowatt, BHP for brake horsepower, N12 for metric horsepower (PS, with 1 PS = 735,49875 W)\n\n* Note 1: There are many different ways of measuring an engine's power. For an overview, see  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower#Engine\_power\_test\_codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower#Engine_power_test_codes).\n* Note 2: You can link to information about how the given value has been determined using the [[valueReference]] property.\n* Note 3: You can use [[minValue]] and [[maxValue]] to indicate ranges.
- engineType: The type of engine or engines powering the vehicle.
- torque: The torque (turning force) of the vehicle's engine.\n\nTypical unit code(s): NU for newton metre (N m), F17 for pound-force per foot, or F48 for pound-force per inch\n\n* Note 1: You can link to information about how the given value has been determined (e.g. reference RPM) using the [[valueReference]] property.\n* Note 2: You can use [[minValue]] and [[maxValue]] to indicate ranges.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface EngineSpecification {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'EngineSpecification'
  engineDisplacement?: QuantitativeValue
  enginePower?: QuantitativeValue
  engineType?: QualitativeValue | string
  torque?: QuantitativeValue
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "EngineSpecification",
  "name": "Example EngineSpecification",
  "description": "An example of the EngineSpecification type",
  "url": "https://example.com/enginespecification",
  "identifier": "example-enginespecification-1"
}
```

## Notes

- EngineSpecification inherits all properties from StructuredValue
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
