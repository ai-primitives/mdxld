## Usage Example

```typescript
interface EngineSpecification extends StructuredValue {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'EngineSpecification'
  enginePower?: QuantitativeValue
  engineDisplacement?: QuantitativeValue
  engineType?: QualitativeValue | string
  torque?: QuantitativeValue
  fuelType?: QualitativeValue | string
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "EngineSpecification",
  "name": "Example EngineSpecification",
  "description": "An example of the EngineSpecification type",
  "url": "https://example.com/enginespecification",
  "identifier": "example-enginespecification-1"
}
```

## Notes

- EngineSpecification inherits all properties from StructuredValue
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
