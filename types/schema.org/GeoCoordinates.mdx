For backward compatibility, a 3-letter [ISO 3166-1 alpha-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3) country code such as "SGP" or a full country name such as "Singapore" can also be used.

      type: string
      description: An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the
    use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface GeoCoordinates extends StructuredValue {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'GeoCoordinates'
  addressCountry?: Country | string
  address?: PostalAddress | string
  postalCode?: string
  latitude?: number | string
  elevation?: number | string
  longitude?: number | string
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "GeoCoordinates",

  "url": "https://example.com/geocoordinates",
  "identifier": "example-geocoordinates-1"
}
```

## Notes

- GeoCoordinates inherits all properties from StructuredValue
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
