# PublicationIssue

A part of a successively published publication such as a periodical or publication volume, often numbered, usually containing a grouping of works such as articles.\n\nSee also [blog post](http://blog.schema.org/2014/09/schemaorg-support-for-bibliographic_2.html).

## Type Hierarchy

PublicationIssue is a type of CreativeWork.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from PublicationIssue:

- ComicIssue: Individual comic issues are serially published as
    	part of a larger series. For the sake of consistency, even one-shot issues
    	belong to a series comprised of a single issue. All comic issues can be
    	uniquely identified by: the combination of the name and volume number of the
    	series to which the issue belongs; the issue number; and the variant
    	description of the issue (if any).

## Properties

PublicationIssue defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from CreativeWork:

- issueNumber: Identifies the issue of publication; for example, "iii" or "2".
