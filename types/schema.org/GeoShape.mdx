# GeoShape

The geographic shape of a place. A GeoShape can be described using several properties whose values are based on latitude/longitude pairs. Either whitespace or commas can be used to separate latitude and longitude; whitespace should be used when writing a list of several such points.

## Type Hierarchy

GeoShape is a type of StructuredValue.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from GeoShape:

- GeoCircle: A GeoCircle is a GeoShape representing a circular geographic area. As it is a GeoShape
          it provides the simple textual property 'circle', but also allows the combination of postalCode alongside geoRadius.
          The center of the circle can be indicated via the 'geoMidpoint' property, or more approximately using 'address', 'postalCode'.
       

## Properties

GeoShape defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from StructuredValue:

- box: A box is the area enclosed by the rectangle formed by two points. The first point is the lower corner, the second point is the upper corner. A box is expressed as two points separated by a space character.
- circle: A circle is the circular region of a specified radius centered at a specified latitude and longitude. A circle is expressed as a pair followed by a radius in meters.
- line: A line is a point-to-point path consisting of two or more points. A line is expressed as a series of two or more point objects separated by space.
- polygon: A polygon is the area enclosed by a point-to-point path for which the starting and ending points are the same. A polygon is expressed as a series of four or more space delimited points where the first and final points are identical.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface GeoShape {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'GeoShape'
  box?: string
  circle?: string
  line?: string
  polygon?: string
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "GeoShape",
  "name": "Example GeoShape",
  "description": "An example of the GeoShape type",
  "url": "https://example.com/geoshape",
  "identifier": "example-geoshape-1"
}
```

## Notes

- GeoShape inherits all properties from StructuredValue
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
