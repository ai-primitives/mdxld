# GeoShape

The geographic shape of a place. A GeoShape can be described using several properties whose values are based on latitude/longitude pairs. Either whitespace or commas can be used to separate latitude and longitude; whitespace should be used when writing a list of several such points.

## Type Hierarchy

GeoShape is a type of StructuredValue.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from GeoShape:

- GeoCircle: A GeoCircle is a GeoShape representing a circular geographic area. As it is a GeoShape
          it provides the simple textual property 'circle', but also allows the combination of postalCode alongside geoRadius.
          The center of the circle can be indicated via the 'geoMidpoint' property, or more approximately using 'address', 'postalCode'.
       

## Properties

### Direct Properties

- addressCountry: The country. Recommended to be in 2-letter [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1) format, for example "US". For backward compatibility, a 3-letter [ISO 3166-1 alpha-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3) country code such as "SGP" or a full country name such as "Singapore" can also be used.
- address: Physical address of the item.
- polygon: A polygon is the area enclosed by a point-to-point path for which the starting and ending points are the same. A polygon is expressed as a series of four or more space delimited points where the first and final points are identical.
- postalCode: The postal code. For example, 94043.
- circle: A circle is the circular region of a specified radius centered at a specified latitude and longitude. A circle is expressed as a pair followed by a radius in meters.
- elevation: The elevation of a location ([WGS 84](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System)). Values may be of the form 'NUMBER UNIT\_OF\_MEASUREMENT' (e.g., '1,000 m', '3,200 ft') while numbers alone should be assumed to be a value in meters.
- line: A line is a point-to-point path consisting of two or more points. A line is expressed as a series of two or more point objects separated by space.
- box: A box is the area enclosed by the rectangle formed by two points. The first point is the lower corner, the second point is the upper corner. A box is expressed as two points separated by a space character.

### Inherited Properties

- name: The name of the item. (inherited from Thing)
- disambiguatingDescription: A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation. (inherited from Thing)
- potentialAction: Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role. (inherited from Thing)
- url: URL of the item. (inherited from Thing)
- identifier: The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of [[Thing]], such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See [background notes](/docs/datamodel.html#identifierBg) for more details.
         (inherited from Thing)
- subjectOf: A CreativeWork or Event about this Thing. (inherited from Thing)
- description: A description of the item. (inherited from Thing)
- additionalType: An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the
    use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface GeoShape extends StructuredValue {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'GeoShape'
  addressCountry?: Country | string
  address?: PostalAddress | string
  polygon?: string
  postalCode?: string
  circle?: string
  elevation?: number | string
  line?: string
  box?: string
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "GeoShape",
  "name": "Example GeoShape",
  "description": "An example of the GeoShape type",
  "url": "https://example.com/geoshape",
  "identifier": "example-geoshape-1"
}
```

## Notes

- GeoShape inherits all properties from StructuredValue
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
