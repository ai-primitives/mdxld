## Usage Example

```typescript
interface DeliveryTimeSettings extends StructuredValue {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'DeliveryTimeSettings'
  shippingDestination?: DefinedRegion
  isUnlabelledFallback?: boolean
  transitTimeLabel?: string
  deliveryTime?: ShippingDeliveryTime
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "DeliveryTimeSettings",
  "name": "Example DeliveryTimeSettings",
  "description": "An example of the DeliveryTimeSettings type",
  "url": "https://example.com/deliverytimesettings",
  "identifier": "example-deliverytimesettings-1"
}
```

- DeliveryTimeSettings inherits all properties from StructuredValue
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
