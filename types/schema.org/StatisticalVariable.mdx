description: [[StatisticalVariable]] represents any type of statistical metric that can be measured at a place and time. The usage pattern for [[StatisticalVariable]] is typically expressed using [[Observation]] with an explicit [[populationType]], which is a type, typically drawn from Schema.org. Each [[StatisticalVariable]] is marked as a [[ConstraintNode]], meaning that some properties (those listed using [[constraintProperty]]) serve in this setting solely to define the statistical variable rather than literally describe a specific person, place or thing. For example, a [[StatisticalVariable]] Median_Height_Person_Female representing the median height of women, could be written as follows: the population type is [[Person]]; the measuredProperty [[height]]; the [[statType]] [[median]]; the [[gender]] [[Female]]. It is important to note that there are many kinds of scientific quantitative observation which are not fully, perfectly or unambiguously described following this pattern, or with solely Schema.org terminology. The approach taken here is designed to allow partial, incremental or minimal description of [[StatisticalVariable]]s, and the use of detailed sets of entity and property IDs from external repositories.

# StatisticalVariable

[[StatisticalVariable]] represents any type of statistical metric that can be measured at a place and time. The usage pattern for [[StatisticalVariable]] is typically expressed using [[Observation]] with an explicit [[populationType]], which is a type, typically drawn from Schema.org. Each [[StatisticalVariable]] is marked as a [[ConstraintNode]], meaning that some properties (those listed using [[constraintProperty]]) serve in this setting solely to define the statistical variable rather than literally describe a specific person, place or thing. For example, a [[StatisticalVariable]] Median_Height_Person_Female representing the median height of women, could be written as follows: the population type is [[Person]]; the measuredProperty [[height]]; the [[statType]] [[median]]; the [[gender]] [[Female]]. It is important to note that there are many kinds of scientific quantitative observation which are not fully, perfectly or unambiguously described following this pattern, or with solely Schema.org terminology. The approach taken here is designed to allow partial, incremental or minimal description of [[StatisticalVariable]]s, and the use of detailed sets of entity and property IDs from external repositories. The [[measurementMethod]], [[unitCode]] and [[unitText]] properties can also be used to clarify the specific nature and notation of an observed measurement. 

## Type Hierarchy

StatisticalVariable is a type of ConstraintNode.

### Direct Subtypes

No types directly inherit from StatisticalVariable.

## Properties

StatisticalVariable defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from ConstraintNode:

- statType: Indicates the kind of statistic represented by a [[StatisticalVariable]], e.g. mean, count etc. The value of statType is a property, either from within Schema.org (e.g. [[median]], [[marginOfError]], [[maxValue]], [[minValue]]) or from other compatible (e.g. RDF) systems such as DataCommons.org or Wikidata.org. 

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface StatisticalVariable {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'StatisticalVariable'
  statType?: Property | string
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "StatisticalVariable",
  "name": "Example StatisticalVariable",
  "description": "An example of the StatisticalVariable type",
  "url": "https://example.com/statisticalvariable",
  "identifier": "example-statisticalvariable-1"
}
```

## Notes

- StatisticalVariable inherits all properties from ConstraintNode
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
