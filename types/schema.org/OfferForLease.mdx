      description: An item being offered (or demanded). The transactional nature of the offer or demand is documented using [[businessFunction]], e.g. sell, lease etc. While several common expected types are listed explicitly in this definition, others can be used. Using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer.

      type: PropertyValue
      description: A property-value pair representing an additional characteristic of the entity, e.g. a product feature or another characteristic for which there is no matching property in schema.org.\n\nNote: Publishers should be aware that applications designed to use specific schema.org properties (e.g. https://schema.org/width, https://schema.org/color, https://schema.org/gtin13, ...) will typically expect such data to be provided using those properties, rather than using the generic property/value mechanism.

      description: The offer price of a product, or of a price component when attached to PriceSpecification and its subtypes.\n\nUsage guidelines:\n\n* Use the [[priceCurrency]] property (with standard formats: [ISO 4217 currency format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217), e.g. "USD"; [Ticker symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptocurrencies) for cryptocurrencies, e.g. "BTC"; well known names for [Local Exchange Trading Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_exchange_trading_system) (LETS) and other currency types, e.g. "Ithaca HOUR") instead of including [ambiguous symbols](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_sign#Currencies_that_use_the_dollar_or_peso_sign) such as '$' in the value.\n* Use '.' (Unicode 'FULL STOP' (U+002E)) rather than ',' to indicate a decimal point. Avoid using these symbols as a readability separator.\n* Note that both [RDFa](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/#using-the-content-attribute) and Microdata syntax allow the use of a "content=" attribute for publishing simple machine-readable values alongside more human-friendly formatting.\n* Use values from 0123456789 (Unicode 'DIGIT ZERO' (U+0030) to 'DIGIT NINE' (U+0039)) rather than superficially similar Unicode symbols.

    - name: mobileUrl
      type: string
      description: The [[mobileUrl]] property is provided for specific situations in which data consumers need to determine whether one of several provided URLs is a dedicated 'mobile site'.

To discourage over-use, and reflecting intial usecases, the property is expected only on [[Product]] and [[Offer]], rather than [[Thing]]. The general trend in web technology is towards [responsive design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design) in which content can be flexibly adapted to a wide range of browsing environments. Pages and sites referenced with the long-established [[url]] property should ideally also be usable on a wide variety of devices, including mobile phones. In most cases, it would be pointless and counter productive to attempt to update all [[url]] markup to use [[mobileUrl]] for more mobile-oriented pages. The property is intended for the case when items (primarily [[Product]] and [[Offer]]) have extra URLs hosted on an additional "mobile site" alongside the main one. It should not be taken as an endorsement of this publication style.

      type: string
      description: A Global Trade Item Number ([GTIN](https://www.gs1.org/standards/id-keys/gtin)). GTINs identify trade items, including products and services, using numeric identification codes.

A correct [[gtin]] value should be a valid GTIN, which means that it should be an all-numeric string of either 8, 12, 13 or 14 digits, or a "GS1 Digital Link" URL based on such a string. The numeric component should also have a [valid GS1 check digit](https://www.gs1.org/services/check-digit-calculator) and meet the other rules for valid GTINs. See also [GS1's GTIN Summary](http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/idkeys/gtin) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Trade_Item_Number) for more details. Left-padding of the gtin values is not required or encouraged. The [[gtin]] property generalizes the earlier [[gtin8]], [[gtin12]], [[gtin13]], and [[gtin14]] properties.

The GS1 [digital link specifications](https://www.gs1.org/standards/Digital-Link/) expresses GTINs as URLs (URIs, IRIs, etc.).
Digital Links should be populated into the [[hasGS1DigitalLink]] attribute.

Note also that this is a definition for how to include GTINs in Schema.org data, and not a definition of GTINs in general - see the GS1 documentation for authoritative details.

Former 12-digit UPC codes can be converted into a GTIN-13 code by simply adding a preceding zero. See [GS1 GTIN Summary](http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/idkeys/gtin) for more details. (inherited from Offer)

- areaServed: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided. (inherited from Offer)

- hasGS1DigitalLink: The <a href="https://www.gs1.org/standards/gs1-digital-link">GS1 digital link</a> associated with the object. This URL should conform to the particular requirements of digital links. The link should only contain the Application Identifiers (AIs) that are relevant for the entity being annotated, for instance a [[Product]] or an [[Organization]], and for the correct granularity. In particular, for products:<ul><li>A Digital Link that contains a serial number (AI <code>21</code>) should only be present on instances of [[IndividualProduct]]</li><li>A Digital Link that contains a lot number (AI <code>10</code>) should be annotated as [[SomeProduct]] if only products from that lot are sold, or [[IndividualProduct]] if there is only a specific product.</li><li>A Digital Link that contains a global model number (AI <code>8013</code>)  should be attached to a [[Product]] or a [[ProductModel]].</li></ul> Other item types should be adapted similarly. (inherited from Offer)
- gtin8: The GTIN-8 code of the product, or the product to which the offer refers. This code is also known as EAN/UCC-8 or 8-digit EAN. See [GS1 GTIN Summary](http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/idkeys/gtin) for more details. (inherited from Offer)
- reviews: Review of the item. (inherited from Offer)
- gtin: A Global Trade Item Number ([GTIN](https://www.gs1.org/standards/id-keys/gtin)). GTINs identify trade items, including products and services, using numeric identification codes.

A correct [[gtin]] value should be a valid GTIN, which means that it should be an all-numeric string of either 8, 12, 13 or 14 digits, or a "GS1 Digital Link" URL based on such a string. The numeric component should also have a [valid GS1 check digit](https://www.gs1.org/services/check-digit-calculator) and meet the other rules for valid GTINs. See also [GS1's GTIN Summary](http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/idkeys/gtin) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Trade_Item_Number) for more details. Left-padding of the gtin values is not required or encouraged. The [[gtin]] property generalizes the earlier [[gtin8]], [[gtin12]], [[gtin13]], and [[gtin14]] properties.

The GS1 [digital link specifications](https://www.gs1.org/standards/Digital-Link/) expresses GTINs as URLs (URIs, IRIs, etc.).
Digital Links should be populated into the [[hasGS1DigitalLink]] attribute.

Note also that this is a definition for how to include GTINs in Schema.org data, and not a definition of GTINs in general - see the GS1 documentation for authoritative details. (inherited from Offer)
