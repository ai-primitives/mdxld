# Review

A review of an item - for example, of a restaurant, movie, or store.

## Type Hierarchy

Review is a type of CreativeWork.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from Review:

- ClaimReview: A fact-checking review of claims made (or reported) in some creative work (referenced via itemReviewed).
- CriticReview: A [[CriticReview]] is a more specialized form of Review written or published by a source that is recognized for its reviewing activities. These can include online columns, travel and food guides, TV and radio shows, blogs and other independent Web sites. [[CriticReview]]s are typically more in-depth and professionally written. For simpler, casually written user/visitor/viewer/customer reviews, it is more appropriate to use the [[UserReview]] type. Review aggregator sites such as Metacritic already separate out the site's user reviews from selected critic reviews that originate from third-party sources.
- EmployerReview: An [[EmployerReview]] is a review of an [[Organization]] regarding its role as an employer, written by a current or former employee of that organization.
- MediaReview: A [[MediaReview]] is a more specialized form of Review dedicated to the evaluation of media content online, typically in the context of fact-checking and misinformation.
    For more general reviews of media in the broader sense, use [[UserReview]], [[CriticReview]] or other [[Review]] types. This definition is
    a work in progress. While the [[MediaManipulationRatingEnumeration]] list reflects significant community review amongst fact-checkers and others working
    to combat misinformation, the specific structures for representing media objects, their versions and publication context, are still evolving. Similarly, best practices for the relationship between [[MediaReview]] and [[ClaimReview]] markup have not yet been finalized.
- Recommendation: [[Recommendation]] is a type of [[Review]] that suggests or proposes something as the best option or best course of action. Recommendations may be for products or services, or other concrete things, as in the case of a ranked list or product guide. A [[Guide]] may list multiple recommendations for different categories. For example, in a [[Guide]] about which TVs to buy, the author may have several [[Recommendation]]s.
- UserReview: A review created by an end-user (e.g. consumer, purchaser, attendee etc.), in contrast with [[CriticReview]].

## Properties

Review defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from CreativeWork:

- associatedClaimReview: An associated [[ClaimReview]], related by specific common content, topic or claim. The expectation is that this property would be most typically used in cases where a single activity is conducting both claim reviews and media reviews, in which case [[relatedMediaReview]] would commonly be used on a [[ClaimReview]], while [[relatedClaimReview]] would be used on [[MediaReview]].
- associatedMediaReview: An associated [[MediaReview]], related by specific common content, topic or claim. The expectation is that this property would be most typically used in cases where a single activity is conducting both claim reviews and media reviews, in which case [[relatedMediaReview]] would commonly be used on a [[ClaimReview]], while [[relatedClaimReview]] would be used on [[MediaReview]].
- associatedReview: An associated [[Review]].
- reviewBody: The actual body of the review.
- reviewRating: The rating given in this review. Note that reviews can themselves be rated. The ```reviewRating``` applies to rating given by the review. The [[aggregateRating]] property applies to the review itself, as a creative work.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface Review {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'Review'
  associatedClaimReview?: Review
  associatedMediaReview?: Review
  associatedReview?: Review
  reviewBody?: string
  reviewRating?: Rating
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "Review",
  "name": "Example Review",
  "description": "An example of the Review type",
  "url": "https://example.com/review",
  "identifier": "example-review-1"
}
```

## Notes

- Review inherits all properties from CreativeWork
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
