Since schema.org types like [[Movie]] and [[TVEpisode]] can be used for both works and their multiple expressions, it is possible to use [[titleEIDR]] alone (for a general description), or alongside [[editEIDR]] for a more edit-specific description.

    - name: temporalCoverage
      type: string
      description: The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as a textual string indicating a time period in [ISO 8601 time interval format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals). In
      the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written "2011/2012"). Other forms of content, e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode, may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL.
      Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via "1939/1945".

Open-ended date ranges can be written with ".." in place of the end date. For example, "2015-11/.." indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated.

A maintainer is a [[Person]] or [[Organization]] that manages contributions to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on "upstream" sources. When [[maintainer]] is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a [[Dataset]], it is always  possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The [[isBasedOn]] property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work.

# SoftwareSourceCode

Computer programming source code. Example: Full (compile ready) solutions, code snippet samples, scripts, templates.

## Type Hierarchy

SoftwareSourceCode is a type of CreativeWork.

### Direct Subtypes

No types directly inherit from SoftwareSourceCode.

## Properties

### Direct Properties

- sampleType: What type of code sample: full (compile ready) solution, code snippet, inline code, scripts, template.
- programmingLanguage: The computer programming language.
- codeSampleType: What type of code sample: full (compile ready) solution, code snippet, inline code, scripts, template.
- runtime: Runtime platform or script interpreter dependencies (example: Java v1, Python 2.3, .NET Framework 3.0).
- targetProduct: Target Operating System / Product to which the code applies.  If applies to several versions, just the product name can be used.
- runtimePlatform: Runtime platform or script interpreter dependencies (example: Java v1, Python 2.3, .NET Framework 3.0).
- codeRepository: Link to the repository where the un-compiled, human readable code and related code is located (SVN, GitHub, CodePlex).

### Inherited Properties

- interactionStatistic: The number of interactions for the CreativeWork using the WebSite or SoftwareApplication. The most specific child type of InteractionCounter should be used. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- contributor: A secondary contributor to the CreativeWork or Event. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- publishingPrinciples: The publishingPrinciples property indicates (typically via [[URL]]) a document describing the editorial principles of an [[Organization]] (or individual, e.g. a [[Person]] writing a blog) that relate to their activities as a publisher, e.g. ethics or diversity policies. When applied to a [[CreativeWork]] (e.g. [[NewsArticle]]) the principles are those of the party primarily responsible for the creation of the [[CreativeWork]].

While such policies are most typically expressed in natural language, sometimes related information (e.g. indicating a [[funder]]) can be expressed using schema.org terminology.
 (inherited from CreativeWork)
- exampleOfWork: A creative work that this work is an example/instance/realization/derivation of. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- contentReferenceTime: The specific time described by a creative work, for works (e.g. articles, video objects etc.) that emphasise a particular moment within an Event. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- fileFormat: Media type, typically MIME format (see [IANA site](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml)) of the content, e.g. application/zip of a SoftwareApplication binary. In cases where a CreativeWork has several media type representations, 'encoding' can be used to indicate each MediaObject alongside particular fileFormat information. Unregistered or niche file formats can be indicated instead via the most appropriate URL, e.g. defining Web page or a Wikipedia entry. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- copyrightNotice: Text of a notice appropriate for describing the copyright aspects of this Creative Work, ideally indicating the owner of the copyright for the Work. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- educationalAlignment: An alignment to an established educational framework.

This property should not be used where the nature of the alignment can be described using a simple property, for example to express that a resource [[teaches]] or [[assesses]] a competency. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- mentions: Indicates that the CreativeWork contains a reference to, but is not necessarily about a concept. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- temporal: The "temporal" property can be used in cases where more specific properties
(e.g. [[temporalCoverage]], [[dateCreated]], [[dateModified]], [[datePublished]]) are not known to be appropriate. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- material: A material that something is made from, e.g. leather, wool, cotton, paper. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- associatedMedia: A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. This property is a synonym for encoding. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- version: The version of the CreativeWork embodied by a specified resource. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- award: An award won by or for this item. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- learningResourceType: The predominant type or kind characterizing the learning resource. For example, 'presentation', 'handout'. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- encoding: A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. This property is a synonym for associatedMedia. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- recordedAt: The Event where the CreativeWork was recorded. The CreativeWork may capture all or part of the event. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- encodingFormat: Media type typically expressed using a MIME format (see [IANA site](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml) and [MDN reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types)), e.g. application/zip for a SoftwareApplication binary, audio/mpeg for .mp3 etc.

In cases where a [[CreativeWork]] has several media type representations, [[encoding]] can be used to indicate each [[MediaObject]] alongside particular [[encodingFormat]] information.

Unregistered or niche encoding and file formats can be indicated instead via the most appropriate URL, e.g. defining Web page or a Wikipedia/Wikidata entry. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- accessibilitySummary: A human-readable summary of specific accessibility features or deficiencies, consistent with the other accessibility metadata but expressing subtleties such as "short descriptions are present but long descriptions will be needed for non-visual users" or "short descriptions are present and no long descriptions are needed". (inherited from CreativeWork)
- editor: Specifies the Person who edited the CreativeWork. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- copyrightHolder: The party holding the legal copyright to the CreativeWork. (inherited from CreativeWork)

- about: The subject matter of the content. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- alternativeHeadline: A secondary title of the CreativeWork. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- commentCount: The number of comments this CreativeWork (e.g. Article, Question or Answer) has received. This is most applicable to works published in Web sites with commenting system; additional comments may exist elsewhere. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- funder: A person or organization that supports (sponsors) something through some kind of financial contribution. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- datePublished: Date of first publication or broadcast. For example the date a [[CreativeWork]] was broadcast or a [[Certification]] was issued. (inherited from CreativeWork)

- isBasedOnUrl: A resource that was used in the creation of this resource. This term can be repeated for multiple sources. For example, http://example.com/great-multiplication-intro.html. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- thumbnail: Thumbnail image for an image or video. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- video: An embedded video object. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- keywords: Keywords or tags used to describe some item. Multiple textual entries in a keywords list are typically delimited by commas, or by repeating the property. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- creditText: Text that can be used to credit person(s) and/or organization(s) associated with a published Creative Work. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- size: A standardized size of a product or creative work, specified either through a simple textual string (for example 'XL', '32Wx34L'), a  QuantitativeValue with a unitCode, or a comprehensive and structured [[SizeSpecification]]; in other cases, the [[width]], [[height]], [[depth]] and [[weight]] properties may be more applicable.  (inherited from CreativeWork)
- license: A license document that applies to this content, typically indicated by URL. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- isAccessibleForFree: A flag to signal that the item, event, or place is accessible for free. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- acquireLicensePage: Indicates a page documenting how licenses can be purchased or otherwise acquired, for the current item. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- discussionUrl: A link to the page containing the comments of the CreativeWork. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- editEIDR: An [EIDR](https://eidr.org/) (Entertainment Identifier Registry) [[identifier]] representing a specific edit / edition for a work of film or television.

For example, the motion picture known as "Ghostbusters" whose [[titleEIDR]] is "10.5240/7EC7-228A-510A-053E-CBB8-J" has several edits, e.g. "10.5240/1F2A-E1C5-680A-14C6-E76B-I" and "10.5240/8A35-3BEE-6497-5D12-9E4F-3".

Since schema.org types like [[Movie]] and [[TVEpisode]] can be used for both works and their multiple expressions, it is possible to use [[titleEIDR]] alone (for a general description), or alongside [[editEIDR]] for a more edit-specific description.
 (inherited from CreativeWork)
- spatialCoverage: The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the place(s) which are the focus of the content. It is a subproperty of
      contentLocation intended primarily for more technical and detailed materials. For example with a Dataset, it indicates
      areas that the dataset describes: a dataset of New York weather would have spatialCoverage which was the place: the state of New York. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- sdPublisher: Indicates the party responsible for generating and publishing the current structured data markup, typically in cases where the structured data is derived automatically from existing published content but published on a different site. For example, student projects and open data initiatives often re-publish existing content with more explicitly structured metadata. The
[[sdPublisher]] property helps make such practices more explicit. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- dateCreated: The date on which the CreativeWork was created or the item was added to a DataFeed. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- encodings: A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. (inherited from CreativeWork)

- producer: The person or organization who produced the work (e.g. music album, movie, TV/radio series etc.). (inherited from CreativeWork)
- accessibilityControl: Identifies input methods that are sufficient to fully control the described resource. Values should be drawn from the [approved vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/2021/a11y-discov-vocab/latest/#accessibilityControl-vocabulary). (inherited from CreativeWork)
- author: The author of this content or rating. Please note that author is special in that HTML 5 provides a special mechanism for indicating authorship via the rel tag. That is equivalent to this and may be used interchangeably. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- educationalLevel: The level in terms of progression through an educational or training context. Examples of educational levels include 'beginner', 'intermediate' or 'advanced', and formal sets of level indicators. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- genre: Genre of the creative work, broadcast channel or group. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- isPartOf: Indicates an item or CreativeWork that this item, or CreativeWork (in some sense), is part of. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- archivedAt: Indicates a page or other link involved in archival of a [[CreativeWork]]. In the case of [[MediaReview]], the items in a [[MediaReviewItem]] may often become inaccessible, but be archived by archival, journalistic, activist, or law enforcement organizations. In such cases, the referenced page may not directly publish the content. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- copyrightYear: The year during which the claimed copyright for the CreativeWork was first asserted. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- headline: Headline of the article. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- reviews: Review of the item. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- interpretedAsClaim: Used to indicate a specific claim contained, implied, translated or refined from the content of a [[MediaObject]] or other [[CreativeWork]]. The interpreting party can be indicated using [[claimInterpreter]]. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- publisher: The publisher of the creative work. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- review: A review of the item. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- creativeWorkStatus: The status of a creative work in terms of its stage in a lifecycle. Example terms include Incomplete, Draft, Published, Obsolete. Some organizations define a set of terms for the stages of their publication lifecycle. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- audio: An embedded audio object. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- educationalUse: The purpose of a work in the context of education; for example, 'assignment', 'group work'. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- countryOfOrigin: The country of origin of something, including products as well as creative  works such as movie and TV content.

In the case of TV and movie, this would be the country of the principle offices of the production company or individual responsible for the movie. For other kinds of [[CreativeWork]] it is difficult to provide fully general guidance, and properties such as [[contentLocation]] and [[locationCreated]] may be more applicable.

In the case of products, the country of origin of the product. The exact interpretation of this may vary by context and product type, and cannot be fully enumerated here. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- interactivityType: The predominant mode of learning supported by the learning resource. Acceptable values are 'active', 'expositive', or 'mixed'. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- offers: An offer to provide this item&#x2014;for example, an offer to sell a product, rent the DVD of a movie, perform a service, or give away tickets to an event. Use [[businessFunction]] to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a [[Demand]]. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer.
       (inherited from CreativeWork)
- temporalCoverage: The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as a textual string indicating a time period in [ISO 8601 time interval format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals). In
      the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written "2011/2012"). Other forms of content, e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode, may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL.
      Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via "1939/1945".

Open-ended date ranges can be written with ".." in place of the end date. For example, "2015-11/.." indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- sdLicense: A license document that applies to this structured data, typically indicated by URL. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- publisherImprint: The publishing division which published the comic. (inherited from CreativeWork)

- accountablePerson: Specifies the Person that is legally accountable for the CreativeWork. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- workTranslation: A work that is a translation of the content of this work. E.g. 西遊記 has an English workTranslation “Journey to the West”, a German workTranslation “Monkeys Pilgerfahrt” and a Vietnamese  translation Tây du ký bình khảo. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- contentRating: Official rating of a piece of content&#x2014;for example, 'MPAA PG-13'. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- awards: Awards won by or for this item. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- spatial: The "spatial" property can be used in cases when more specific properties
(e.g. [[locationCreated]], [[spatialCoverage]], [[contentLocation]]) are not known to be appropriate. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- assesses: The item being described is intended to assess the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- translationOfWork: The work that this work has been translated from. E.g. 物种起源 is a translationOf “On the Origin of Species”. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- schemaVersion: Indicates (by URL or string) a particular version of a schema used in some CreativeWork. This property was created primarily to
    indicate the use of a specific schema.org release, e.g. ```10.0``` as a simple string, or more explicitly via URL, ```https://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v10.0```. There may be situations in which other schemas might usefully be referenced this way, e.g. ```http://dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dces/1999-07-02/``` but this has not been carefully explored in the community. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- locationCreated: The location where the CreativeWork was created, which may not be the same as the location depicted in the CreativeWork. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- teaches: The item being described is intended to help a person learn the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- mainEntity: Indicates the primary entity described in some page or other CreativeWork. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- conditionsOfAccess: Conditions that affect the availability of, or method(s) of access to, an item. Typically used for real world items such as an [[ArchiveComponent]] held by an [[ArchiveOrganization]]. This property is not suitable for use as a general Web access control mechanism. It is expressed only in natural language.\n\nFor example "Available by appointment from the Reading Room" or "Accessible only from logged-in accounts ".  (inherited from CreativeWork)
- publication: A publication event associated with the item. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- [object Object]: [object Object] (inherited from CreativeWork)
- usageInfo: The schema.org [[usageInfo]] property indicates further information about a [[CreativeWork]]. This property is applicable both to works that are freely available and to those that require payment or other transactions. It can reference additional information, e.g. community expectations on preferred linking and citation conventions, as well as purchasing details. For something that can be commercially licensed, usageInfo can provide detailed, resource-specific information about licensing options.

This property can be used alongside the license property which indicates license(s) applicable to some piece of content. The usageInfo property can provide information about other licensing options, e.g. acquiring commercial usage rights for an image that is also available under non-commercial creative commons licenses. (inherited from CreativeWork)
- accessModeSufficient: A list of single or combined accessModes that are sufficient to understand all the intellectual content of a resource. Values should be drawn from the [approved vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/2021/a11y-discov-vocab/latest/#accessModeSufficient-vocabulary). (inherited from CreativeWork)
- maintainer: A maintainer of a [[Dataset]], software package ([[SoftwareApplication]]), or other [[Project]]. A maintainer is a [[Person]] or [[Organization]] that manages contributions to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on "upstream" sources. When [[maintainer]] is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a [[Dataset]], it is always  possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The [[isBasedOn]] property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work.
       (inherited from CreativeWork)
