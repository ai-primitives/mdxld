# FinancialProduct

A product provided to consumers and businesses by financial institutions such as banks, insurance companies, brokerage firms, consumer finance companies, and investment companies which comprise the financial services industry.

## Type Hierarchy

FinancialProduct is a type of Service.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from FinancialProduct:

- BankAccount: A product or service offered by a bank whereby one may deposit, withdraw or transfer money and in some cases be paid interest.

- InvestmentOrDeposit: A type of financial product that typically requires the client to transfer funds to a financial service in return for potential beneficial financial return.
- LoanOrCredit: A financial product for the loaning of an amount of money, or line of credit, under agreed terms and charges.
