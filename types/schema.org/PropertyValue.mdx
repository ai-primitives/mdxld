# PropertyValue

A property-value pair, e.g. representing a feature of a product or place. Use the 'name' property for the name of the property. If there is an additional human-readable version of the value, put that into the 'description' property.\n\n Always use specific schema.org properties when a) they exist and b) you can populate them. Using PropertyValue as a substitute will typically not trigger the same effect as using the original, specific property.
    

## Type Hierarchy

PropertyValue is a type of StructuredValue.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from PropertyValue:

- LocationFeatureSpecification: Specifies a location feature by providing a structured value representing a feature of an accommodation as a property-value pair of varying degrees of formality.

## Properties

PropertyValue defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from StructuredValue:

- propertyID: A commonly used identifier for the characteristic represented by the property, e.g. a manufacturer or a standard code for a property. propertyID can be
(1) a prefixed string, mainly meant to be used with standards for product properties; (2) a site-specific, non-prefixed string (e.g. the primary key of the property or the vendor-specific ID of the property), or (3)
a URL indicating the type of the property, either pointing to an external vocabulary, or a Web resource that describes the property (e.g. a glossary entry).
Standards bodies should promote a standard prefix for the identifiers of properties from their standards.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface PropertyValue {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'PropertyValue'
  propertyID?: string
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "PropertyValue",
  "name": "Example PropertyValue",
  "description": "An example of the PropertyValue type",
  "url": "https://example.com/propertyvalue",
  "identifier": "example-propertyvalue-1"
}
```

## Notes

- PropertyValue inherits all properties from StructuredValue
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
