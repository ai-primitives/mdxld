description: A property-value pair, e.g. representing a feature of a product or place. Use the 'name' property for the name of the property. If there is an additional human-readable version of the value, put that into the 'description' property.\n\n Always use specific schema.org properties when a) they exist and b) you can populate them.

    - name: propertyID
      type: string
      description: A commonly used identifier for the characteristic represented by the property, e.g. a manufacturer or a standard code for a property. propertyID can be
(1) a prefixed string, mainly meant to be used with standards for product properties; (2) a site-specific, non-prefixed string (e.g. the primary key of the property or the vendor-specific ID of the property), or (3)
a URL indicating the type of the property, either pointing to an external vocabulary, or a Web resource that describes the property (e.g. a glossary entry).
Standards bodies should promote a standard prefix for the identifiers of properties from their standards.

      description: The value of a [[QuantitativeValue]] (including [[Observation]]) or property value node.\n\n* For [[QuantitativeValue]] and [[MonetaryAmount]], the recommended type for values is 'Number'.\n* For [[PropertyValue]], it can be 'Text', 'Number', 'Boolean', or 'StructuredValue'.\n* Use values from 0123456789 (Unicode 'DIGIT ZERO' (U+0030) to 'DIGIT NINE' (U+0039)) rather than superficially similar Unicode symbols.\n* Use '.' (Unicode 'FULL STOP' (U+002E)) rather than ',' to indicate a decimal point. Avoid using these symbols as a readability separator.
    - name: measurementTechnique
      type: DefinedTerm | MeasurementMethodEnum | string
      description: A technique, method or technology used in an [[Observation]], [[StatisticalVariable]] or [[Dataset]] (or [[DataDownload]], [[DataCatalog]]), corresponding to the method used for measuring the corresponding variable(s) (for datasets, described using [[variableMeasured]]; for [[Observation]], a [[StatisticalVariable]]). Often but not necessarily each [[variableMeasured]] will have an explicit representation as (or mapping to) an property such as those defined in Schema.org, or other RDF vocabularies and "knowledge graphs". In that case the subproperty of [[variableMeasured]] called [[measuredProperty]] is applicable.
    
The [[measurementTechnique]] property helps when extra clarification is needed about how a [[measuredProperty]] was measured. This is oriented towards scientific and scholarly dataset publication but may have broader applicability; it is not intended as a full representation of measurement, but can often serve as a high level summary for dataset discovery. 

For example, if [[variableMeasured]] is: molecule concentration, [[measurementTechnique]] could be: "mass spectrometry" or "nmr spectroscopy" or "colorimetry" or "immunofluorescence". If the [[variableMeasured]] is "depression rating", the [[measurementTechnique]] could be "Zung Scale" or "HAM-D" or "Beck Depression Inventory". 

If there are several [[variableMeasured]] properties recorded for some given data object, use a [[PropertyValue]] for each [[variableMeasured]] and attach the corresponding [[measurementTechnique]]. The value can also be from an enumeration, organized as a [[MeasurementMetholdEnumeration]].

# PropertyValue

A property-value pair, e.g. representing a feature of a product or place. Use the 'name' property for the name of the property. If there is an additional human-readable version of the value, put that into the 'description' property.\n\n Always use specific schema.org properties when a) they exist and b) you can populate them. Using PropertyValue as a substitute will typically not trigger the same effect as using the original, specific property.
    

## Type Hierarchy

PropertyValue is a type of StructuredValue.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from PropertyValue:

- LocationFeatureSpecification: Specifies a location feature by providing a structured value representing a feature of an accommodation as a property-value pair of varying degrees of formality.

## Properties

### Direct Properties

- minValue: The lower value of some characteristic or property.
- propertyID: A commonly used identifier for the characteristic represented by the property, e.g. a manufacturer or a standard code for a property. propertyID can be
(1) a prefixed string, mainly meant to be used with standards for product properties; (2) a site-specific, non-prefixed string (e.g. the primary key of the property or the vendor-specific ID of the property), or (3)
a URL indicating the type of the property, either pointing to an external vocabulary, or a Web resource that describes the property (e.g. a glossary entry).
Standards bodies should promote a standard prefix for the identifiers of properties from their standards.
- maxValue: The upper value of some characteristic or property.
- unitCode: The unit of measurement given using the UN/CEFACT Common Code (3 characters) or a URL. Other codes than the UN/CEFACT Common Code may be used with a prefix followed by a colon.
- measurementMethod: A subproperty of [[measurementTechnique]] that can be used for specifying specific methods, in particular via [[MeasurementMethodEnum]].
- value: The value of a [[QuantitativeValue]] (including [[Observation]]) or property value node.\n\n* For [[QuantitativeValue]] and [[MonetaryAmount]], the recommended type for values is 'Number'.\n* For [[PropertyValue]], it can be 'Text', 'Number', 'Boolean', or 'StructuredValue'.\n* Use values from 0123456789 (Unicode 'DIGIT ZERO' (U+0030) to 'DIGIT NINE' (U+0039)) rather than superficially similar Unicode symbols.\n* Use '.' (Unicode 'FULL STOP' (U+002E)) rather than ',' to indicate a decimal point. Avoid using these symbols as a readability separator.
- measurementTechnique: A technique, method or technology used in an [[Observation]], [[StatisticalVariable]] or [[Dataset]] (or [[DataDownload]], [[DataCatalog]]), corresponding to the method used for measuring the corresponding variable(s) (for datasets, described using [[variableMeasured]]; for [[Observation]], a [[StatisticalVariable]]).

- unitText: A string or text indicating the unit of measurement. Useful if you cannot provide a standard unit code for
<a href='unitCode'>unitCode</a>.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface PropertyValue extends StructuredValue {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'PropertyValue'
  minValue?: number
  propertyID?: string
  maxValue?: number
  unitCode?: string
  measurementMethod?: DefinedTerm | MeasurementMethodEnum | string
  value?: StructuredValue | boolean | number | string
  measurementTechnique?: DefinedTerm | MeasurementMethodEnum | string
  valueReference?: DefinedTerm | Enumeration | MeasurementTypeEnumeration | PropertyValue | QualitativeValue | QuantitativeValue | StructuredValue | string
  unitText?: string
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "PropertyValue",
  "name": "Example PropertyValue",
  "description": "An example of the PropertyValue type",
  "url": "https://example.com/propertyvalue",
  "identifier": "example-propertyvalue-1"
}
```

## Notes

- PropertyValue inherits all properties from StructuredValue
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
