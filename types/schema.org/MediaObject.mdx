# MediaObject

A media object, such as an image, video, audio, or text object embedded in a web page or a downloadable dataset i.e. DataDownload. Note that a creative work may have many media objects associated with it on the same web page. For example, a page about a single song (MusicRecording) may have a music video (VideoObject), and a high and low bandwidth audio stream (2 AudioObject's).

## Type Hierarchy

MediaObject is a type of CreativeWork.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from MediaObject:

- 3DModel: A 3D model represents some kind of 3D content, which may have [[encoding]]s in one or more [[MediaObject]]s. Many 3D formats are available (e.g. see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:3D_graphics_file_formats)); specific encoding formats can be represented using the [[encodingFormat]] property applied to the relevant [[MediaObject]]. For the
case of a single file published after Zip compression, the convention of appending '+zip' to the [[encodingFormat]] can be used. Geospatial, AR/VR, artistic/animation, gaming, engineering and scientific content can all be represented using [[3DModel]].
- AudioObject: An audio file.
- DataDownload: All or part of a [[Dataset]] in downloadable form. 
- ImageObject: An image file.
- MusicVideoObject: A music video file.
- TextObject: A text file. The text can be unformatted or contain markup, html, etc.
- VideoObject: A video file.

## Properties

MediaObject defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from CreativeWork:

- associatedArticle: A NewsArticle associated with the Media Object.
- bitrate: The bitrate of the media object.
- contentSize: File size in (mega/kilo)bytes.
- contentUrl: Actual bytes of the media object, for example the image file or video file.
- embedUrl: A URL pointing to a player for a specific video. In general, this is the information in the ```src``` element of an ```embed``` tag and should not be the same as the content of the ```loc``` tag.
- encodesCreativeWork: The CreativeWork encoded by this media object.
- playerType: Player type required&#x2014;for example, Flash or Silverlight.
- regionsAllowed: The regions where the media is allowed. If not specified, then it's assumed to be allowed everywhere. Specify the countries in [ISO 3166 format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166).
- sha256: The [SHA-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) SHA256 hash of the content of the item. For example, a zero-length input has value 'e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855'.
- uploadDate: Date (including time if available) when this media object was uploaded to this site.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface MediaObject {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'MediaObject'
  associatedArticle?: NewsArticle
  bitrate?: string
  contentSize?: string
  contentUrl?: string
  embedUrl?: string
  encodesCreativeWork?: CreativeWork
  playerType?: string
  regionsAllowed?: Place
  sha256?: string
  uploadDate?: string
}
```

## Example Usage

```json

- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
