## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "Person",
  "interactionStatistic": "{ /* Example object of type: InteractionCounter */ }",
  "hasCredential": "{ /* Example object of type: EducationalOccupationalCredential */ }",

## Notes

- **Person** is a type of **Thing** and inherits all its properties
- Defines 66 direct properties specific to Person
- Inherits 12 properties from parent types
- This is a leaf type with no subtypes - use it when no more specific type exists
- Ensure all required properties are provided when using this type
- Properties can be used from both direct and inherited sets
- Use TypeScript interface above for proper type checking
