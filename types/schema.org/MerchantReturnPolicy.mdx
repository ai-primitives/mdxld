# MerchantReturnPolicy

A MerchantReturnPolicy provides information about product return policies associated with an [[Organization]], [[Product]], or [[Offer]].

## Type Hierarchy

MerchantReturnPolicy is a type of Intangible.

### Direct Subtypes

No types directly inherit from MerchantReturnPolicy.

## Properties

MerchantReturnPolicy defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from Intangible:

- applicableCountry: A country where a particular merchant return policy applies to, for example the two-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code.
- customerRemorseReturnFees: The type of return fees if the product is returned due to customer remorse.
- customerRemorseReturnLabelSource: The method (from an enumeration) by which the customer obtains a return shipping label for a product returned due to customer remorse.
- customerRemorseReturnShippingFeesAmount: The amount of shipping costs if a product is returned due to customer remorse. Applicable when property [[customerRemorseReturnFees]] equals [[ReturnShippingFees]].
- inStoreReturnsOffered: Are in-store returns offered? (For more advanced return methods use the [[returnMethod]] property.)
- itemDefectReturnFees: The type of return fees for returns of defect products.
- itemDefectReturnLabelSource: The method (from an enumeration) by which the customer obtains a return shipping label for a defect product.
- itemDefectReturnShippingFeesAmount: Amount of shipping costs for defect product returns. Applicable when property [[itemDefectReturnFees]] equals [[ReturnShippingFees]].
- merchantReturnLink: Specifies a Web page or service by URL, for product returns.
- returnLabelSource: The method (from an enumeration) by which the customer obtains a return shipping label for a product returned for any reason.
- returnPolicyCountry: The country where the product has to be sent to for returns, for example "Ireland" using the [[name]] property of [[Country]]. You can also provide the two-letter [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1). Note that this can be different from the country where the product was originally shipped from or sent to.
- returnPolicySeasonalOverride: Seasonal override of a return policy.
