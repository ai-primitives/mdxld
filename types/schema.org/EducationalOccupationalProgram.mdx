# EducationalOccupationalProgram

A program offered by an institution which determines the learning progress to achieve an outcome, usually a credential like a degree or certificate. This would define a discrete set of opportunities (e.g., job, courses) that together constitute a program with a clear start, end, set of requirements, and transition to a new occupational opportunity (e.g., a job), or sometimes a higher educational opportunity (e.g., an advanced degree).

## Type Hierarchy

EducationalOccupationalProgram is a type of Intangible.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from EducationalOccupationalProgram:

- WorkBasedProgram: A program with both an educational and employment component. Typically based at a workplace and structured around work-based learning, with the aim of instilling competencies related to an occupation. WorkBasedProgram is used to distinguish programs such as apprenticeships from school, college or other classroom based educational programs.

## Properties

EducationalOccupationalProgram defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from Intangible:

- applicationDeadline: The date on which the program stops collecting applications for the next enrollment cycle. Flexible application deadlines (for example, a program with rolling admissions) can be described in a textual string, rather than as a DateTime.
- applicationStartDate: The date at which the program begins collecting applications for the next enrollment cycle.
- educationalProgramMode: Similar to courseMode, the medium or means of delivery of the program as a whole. The value may either be a text label (e.g. "online", "onsite" or "blended"; "synchronous" or "asynchronous"; "full-time" or "part-time") or a URL reference to a term from a controlled vocabulary (e.g. https://ceds.ed.gov/element/001311#Asynchronous ).
- hasCourse: A course or class that is one of the learning opportunities that constitute an educational / occupational program. No information is implied about whether the course is mandatory or optional; no guarantee is implied about whether the course will be available to everyone on the program.
- maximumEnrollment: The maximum number of students who may be enrolled in the program.
- programPrerequisites: Prerequisites for enrolling in the program.
- programType: The type of educational or occupational program. For example, classroom, internship, alternance, etc.
- salaryUponCompletion: The expected salary upon completing the training.
- termDuration: The amount of time in a term as defined by the institution. A term is a length of time where students take one or more classes. Semesters and quarters are common units for term.
- termsPerYear: The number of times terms of study are offered per year. Semesters and quarters are common units for term. For example, if the student can only take 2 semesters for the program in one year, then termsPerYear should be 2.
- timeOfDay: The time of day the program normally runs. For example, "evenings".
- timeToComplete: The expected length of time to complete the program if attending full-time.
- typicalCreditsPerTerm: The number of credits or units a full-time student would be expected to take in 1 term however 'term' is defined by the institution.
