# 3DModel

A 3D model represents some kind of 3D content, which may have [[encoding]]s in one or more [[MediaObject]]s. Many 3D formats are available (e.g. see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:3D_graphics_file_formats)); specific encoding formats can be represented using the [[encodingFormat]] property applied to the relevant [[MediaObject]]. For the
case of a single file published after Zip compression, the convention of appending '+zip' to the [[encodingFormat]] can be used. Geospatial, AR/VR, artistic/animation, gaming, engineering and scientific content can all be represented using [[3DModel]].

## Type Hierarchy

3DModel is a type of MediaObject.

### Direct Subtypes

No types directly inherit from 3DModel.

## Properties

3DModel defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from MediaObject:

- isResizable: Whether the 3DModel allows resizing. For example, room layout applications often do not allow 3DModel elements to be resized to reflect reality.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface 3DModel {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: '3DModel'
  isResizable?: boolean
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "3DModel",
  "name": "Example 3DModel",
  "description": "An example of the 3DModel type",
  "url": "https://example.com/3dmodel",
  "identifier": "example-3dmodel-1"
}
```

## Notes

- 3DModel inherits all properties from MediaObject
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
