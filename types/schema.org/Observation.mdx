# Observation

Instances of the class [[Observation]] are used to specify observations about an entity at a particular time. The principal properties of an [[Observation]] are [[observationAbout]], [[measuredProperty]], [[statType]], [[value] and [[observationDate]]  and [[measuredProperty]]. Some but not all Observations represent a [[QuantitativeValue]]. Quantitative observations can be about a [[StatisticalVariable]], which is an abstract specification about which we can make observations that are grounded at a particular location and time.

Observations can also encode a subset of simple RDF-like statements (its observationAbout, a StatisticalVariable, defining the measuredPoperty; its observationAbout property indicating the entity the statement is about, and [[value]] )

In the context of a quantitative knowledge graph, typical properties could include [[measuredProperty]], [[observationAbout]], [[observationDate]], [[value]], [[unitCode]], [[unitText]], [[measurementMethod]].
    

## Type Hierarchy

Observation is the root type in the Schema.org hierarchy. All other types inherit from Thing either directly or indirectly.

### Direct Subtypes

No types directly inherit from Observation.

## Properties

### Direct Properties

- measuredProperty: The measuredProperty of an [[Observation]], typically via its [[StatisticalVariable]]. There are various kinds of applicable [[Property]]: a schema.org property, a property from other RDF-compatible systems, e.g. W3C RDF Data Cube, Data Commons, Wikidata, or schema.org extensions such as [GS1's](https://www.gs1.org/voc/?show=properties).
- measurementMethod: A subproperty of [[measurementTechnique]] that can be used for specifying specific methods, in particular via [[MeasurementMethodEnum]].
- measurementQualifier: Provides additional qualification to an observation. For example, a GDP observation measures the Nominal value.
- variableMeasured: The variableMeasured property can indicate (repeated as necessary) the  variables that are measured in some dataset, either described as text or as pairs of identifier and description using PropertyValue, or more explicitly as a [[StatisticalVariable]].
- marginOfError: A [[marginOfError]] for an [[Observation]].
- observationDate: The observationDate of an [[Observation]].
- observationAbout: The [[observationAbout]] property identifies an entity, often a [[Place]], associated with an [[Observation]].
- measurementDenominator: Identifies the denominator variable when an observation represents a ratio or percentage.
- measurementTechnique: A technique, method or technology used in an [[Observation]], [[StatisticalVariable]] or [[Dataset]] (or [[DataDownload]], [[DataCatalog]]), corresponding to the method used for measuring the corresponding variable(s) (for datasets, described using [[variableMeasured]]; for [[Observation]], a [[StatisticalVariable]]). Often but not necessarily each [[variableMeasured]] will have an explicit representation as (or mapping to) an property such as those defined in Schema.org, or other RDF vocabularies and "knowledge graphs". In that case the subproperty of [[variableMeasured]] called [[measuredProperty]] is applicable.

### Inherited Properties

No inherited properties.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface Observation {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'Observation'
  measuredProperty?: Property
  measurementMethod?: DefinedTerm | MeasurementMethodEnum | string
  measurementQualifier?: Enumeration
  variableMeasured?: Property | PropertyValue | StatisticalVariable | string
  marginOfError?: QuantitativeValue
  observationDate?: string
  observationAbout?: Place | Thing
  measurementDenominator?: StatisticalVariable
  measurementTechnique?: DefinedTerm | MeasurementMethodEnum | string
  observationPeriod?: string
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "Observation",
  "name": "Example Observation",
  "description": "An example of the Observation type",
  "url": "https://example.com/observation",
  "identifier": "example-observation-1"
}
```

## Notes

- Observation inherits all properties from Thing
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
