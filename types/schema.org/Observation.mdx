# Observation

Instances of the class [[Observation]] are used to specify observations about an entity at a particular time. The principal properties of an [[Observation]] are [[observationAbout]], [[measuredProperty]], [[statType]], [[value] and [[observationDate]]  and [[measuredProperty]]. Some but not all Observations represent a [[QuantitativeValue]]. Quantitative observations can be about a [[StatisticalVariable]], which is an abstract specification about which we can make observations that are grounded at a particular location and time.

Observations can also encode a subset of simple RDF-like statements (its observationAbout, a StatisticalVariable, defining the measuredPoperty; its observationAbout property indicating the entity the statement is about, and [[value]] )

In the context of a quantitative knowledge graph, typical properties could include [[measuredProperty]], [[observationAbout]], [[observationDate]], [[value]], [[unitCode]], [[unitText]], [[measurementMethod]].
    

## Type Hierarchy

Observation is the root type in the Schema.org hierarchy. All other types inherit from Thing either directly or indirectly.

### Direct Subtypes

No types directly inherit from Observation.

## Properties

Observation defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from Thing:

- marginOfError: A [[marginOfError]] for an [[Observation]].
- observationAbout: The [[observationAbout]] property identifies an entity, often a [[Place]], associated with an [[Observation]].
- observationDate: The observationDate of an [[Observation]].
- observationPeriod: The length of time an Observation took place over. The format follows `P[0-9]*[Y|M|D|h|m|s]`. For example, P1Y is Period 1 Year, P3M is Period 3 Months, P3h is Period 3 hours.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface Observation {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'Observation'
  marginOfError?: QuantitativeValue
  observationAbout?: Place | Thing
  observationDate?: string
  observationPeriod?: string
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "Observation",
  "name": "Example Observation",
  "description": "An example of the Observation type",
  "url": "https://example.com/observation",
  "identifier": "example-observation-1"
}
```

## Notes

- Observation inherits all properties from Thing
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
