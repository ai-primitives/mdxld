# EnergyConsumptionDetails

EnergyConsumptionDetails represents information related to the energy efficiency of a product that consumes energy. The information that can be provided is based on international regulations such as for example [EU directive 2017/1369](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2017/1369/oj) for energy labeling and the [Energy labeling rule](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/energy-water-use-labeling-consumer) under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) in the US.

## Type Hierarchy

EnergyConsumptionDetails is a type of Intangible.

### Direct Subtypes

No types directly inherit from EnergyConsumptionDetails.

## Properties

EnergyConsumptionDetails defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from Intangible:

- energyEfficiencyScaleMax: Specifies the most energy efficient class on the regulated EU energy consumption scale for the product category a product belongs to. For example, energy consumption for televisions placed on the market after January 1, 2020 is scaled from D to A+++.
- energyEfficiencyScaleMin: Specifies the least energy efficient class on the regulated EU energy consumption scale for the product category a product belongs to. For example, energy consumption for televisions placed on the market after January 1, 2020 is scaled from D to A+++.
- hasEnergyEfficiencyCategory: Defines the energy efficiency Category (which could be either a rating out of range of values or a yes/no certification) for a product according to an international energy efficiency standard.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface EnergyConsumptionDetails {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'EnergyConsumptionDetails'
  energyEfficiencyScaleMax?: EUEnergyEfficiencyEnumeration
  energyEfficiencyScaleMin?: EUEnergyEfficiencyEnumeration
  hasEnergyEfficiencyCategory?: EnergyEfficiencyEnumeration
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "EnergyConsumptionDetails",
  "name": "Example EnergyConsumptionDetails",
  "description": "An example of the EnergyConsumptionDetails type",
  "url": "https://example.com/energyconsumptiondetails",
  "identifier": "example-energyconsumptiondetails-1"
}
```

## Notes

- EnergyConsumptionDetails inherits all properties from Intangible
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
