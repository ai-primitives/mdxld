# Course

A description of an educational course which may be offered as distinct instances which take place at different times or take place at different locations, or be offered through different media or modes of study. An educational course is a sequence of one or more educational events and/or creative works which aims to build knowledge, competence or ability of learners.

## Type Hierarchy

Course is the root type in the Schema.org hierarchy. All other types inherit from Thing either directly or indirectly.

### Direct Subtypes

No types directly inherit from Course.

## Properties

Course defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from Thing:

- courseCode: The identifier for the [[Course]] used by the course [[provider]] (e.g. CS101 or 6.001).
- coursePrerequisites: Requirements for taking the Course. May be completion of another [[Course]] or a textual description like "permission of instructor". Requirements may be a pre-requisite competency, referenced using [[AlignmentObject]].
- hasCourseInstance: An offering of the course at a specific time and place or through specific media or mode of study or to a specific section of students.
- syllabusSections: Indicates (typically several) Syllabus entities that lay out what each section of the overall course will cover.
- totalHistoricalEnrollment: The total number of students that have enrolled in the history of the course.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface Course {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'Course'
  courseCode?: string
  coursePrerequisites?: AlignmentObject | Course | string
  hasCourseInstance?: CourseInstance
  syllabusSections?: Syllabus
  totalHistoricalEnrollment?: number
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "Course",
  "name": "Example Course",
  "description": "An example of the Course type",
  "url": "https://example.com/course",
  "identifier": "example-course-1"
}
```

## Notes

- Course inherits all properties from Thing
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
