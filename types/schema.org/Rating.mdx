# Rating

A rating is an evaluation on a numeric scale, such as 1 to 5 stars.

## Type Hierarchy

Rating is a type of Intangible.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from Rating:

- AggregateRating: The average rating based on multiple ratings or reviews.
- EndorsementRating: An EndorsementRating is a rating that expresses some level of endorsement, for example inclusion in a "critic's pick" blog, a
"Like" or "+1" on a social network. It can be considered the [[result]] of an [[EndorseAction]] in which the [[object]] of the action is rated positively by
some [[agent]]. As is common elsewhere in schema.org, it is sometimes more useful to describe the results of such an action without explicitly describing the [[Action]].

An [[EndorsementRating]] may be part of a numeric scale or organized system, but this is not required: having an explicit type for indicating a positive,
endorsement rating is particularly useful in the absence of numeric scales as it helps consumers understand that the rating is broadly positive.


## Properties

Rating defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from Intangible:

- bestRating: The highest value allowed in this rating system.
- ratingExplanation: A short explanation (e.g. one to two sentences) providing background context and other information that led to the conclusion expressed in the rating. This is particularly applicable to ratings associated with "fact check" markup using [[ClaimReview]].
- ratingValue: The rating for the content.\n\nUsage guidelines:\n\n* Use values from 0123456789 (Unicode 'DIGIT ZERO' (U+0030) to 'DIGIT NINE' (U+0039)) rather than superficially similar Unicode symbols.\n* Use '.' (Unicode 'FULL STOP' (U+002E)) rather than ',' to indicate a decimal point. Avoid using these symbols as a readability separator.
- worstRating: The lowest value allowed in this rating system.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface Rating {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'Rating'
  bestRating?: number | string
  ratingExplanation?: string
  ratingValue?: number | string
  worstRating?: number | string
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "Rating",
  "name": "Example Rating",
  "description": "An example of the Rating type",
  "url": "https://example.com/rating",
  "identifier": "example-rating-1"
}
```

## Notes

- Rating inherits all properties from Intangible
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
