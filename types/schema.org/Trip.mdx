# Trip

A trip or journey. An itinerary of visits to one or more places.

## Type Hierarchy

Trip is a type of Intangible.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from Trip:

- BoatTrip: A trip on a commercial ferry line.
- BusTrip: A trip on a commercial bus line.
- Flight: An airline flight.
- TouristTrip: A tourist trip. A created itinerary of visits to one or more places of interest ([[TouristAttraction]]/[[TouristDestination]]) often linked by a similar theme, geographic area, or interest to a particular [[touristType]]. The [UNWTO](http://www2.unwto.org/) defines tourism trip as the Trip taken by visitors.
  (See examples below.)
- TrainTrip: A trip on a commercial train line.

## Properties

Trip defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from Intangible:

- arrivalTime: The expected arrival time.
- departureTime: The expected departure time.
- itinerary: Destination(s) ( [[Place]] ) that make up a trip. For a trip where destination order is important use [[ItemList]] to specify that order (see examples).
- partOfTrip: Identifies that this [[Trip]] is a subTrip of another Trip.  For example Day 1, Day 2, etc. of a multi-day trip.
- subTrip: Identifies a [[Trip]] that is a subTrip of this Trip.  For example Day 1, Day 2, etc. of a multi-day trip.
- tripOrigin: The location of origin of the trip, prior to any destination(s).

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface Trip {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'Trip'
  arrivalTime?: string
  departureTime?: string
  itinerary?: ItemList | Place
  partOfTrip?: Trip
  subTrip?: Trip
  tripOrigin?: Place
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "Trip",
  "name": "Example Trip",
  "description": "An example of the Trip type",
  "url": "https://example.com/trip",
  "identifier": "example-trip-1"
}
```

## Notes

- Trip inherits all properties from Intangible
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
