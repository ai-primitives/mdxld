- Answer: An answer offered to a question; perhaps correct, perhaps opinionated or wrong.
- CorrectionComment: A [[comment]] that corrects [[CreativeWork]].
- Question: A specific question - e.g. from a user seeking answers online, or collected in a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document.

## Properties

Comment defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from CreativeWork:

- downvoteCount: The number of downvotes this question, answer or comment has received from the community.
