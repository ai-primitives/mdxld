# GeospatialGeometry

(Eventually to be defined as) a supertype of GeoShape designed to accommodate definitions from Geo-Spatial best practices.

## Type Hierarchy

GeospatialGeometry is a type of Intangible.

### Direct Subtypes

No types directly inherit from GeospatialGeometry.

## Properties

### Direct Properties

- geoEquals: Represents spatial relations in which two geometries (or the places they represent) are topologically equal, as defined in [DE-9IM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DE-9IM). "Two geometries are topologically equal if their interiors intersect and no part of the interior or boundary of one geometry intersects the exterior of the other" (a symmetric relationship).
- geoWithin: Represents a relationship between two geometries (or the places they represent), relating a geometry to one that contains it, i.e. it is inside (i.e. within) its interior. As defined in [DE-9IM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DE-9IM).

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface GeospatialGeometry extends Intangible {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'GeospatialGeometry'
  geoEquals?: GeospatialGeometry | Place
  geoWithin?: GeospatialGeometry | Place
  geoCovers?: GeospatialGeometry | Place
