# MolecularEntity

Any constitutionally or isotopically distinct atom, molecule, ion, ion pair, radical, radical ion, complex, conformer etc., identifiable as a separately distinguishable entity.

## Type Hierarchy

MolecularEntity is a type of BioChemEntity.

### Direct Subtypes

No types directly inherit from MolecularEntity.

## Properties

MolecularEntity defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from BioChemEntity:

- inChI: Non-proprietary identifier for molecular entity that can be used in printed and electronic data sources thus enabling easier linking of diverse data compilations.
- inChIKey: InChIKey is a hashed version of the full InChI (using the SHA-256 algorithm).
- iupacName: Systematic method of naming chemical compounds as recommended by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).
- molecularFormula: The empirical formula is the simplest whole number ratio of all the atoms in a molecule.
- molecularWeight: This is the molecular weight of the entity being described, not of the parent. Units should be included in the form '&lt;Number&gt; &lt;unit&gt;', for example '12 amu' or as '&lt;QuantitativeValue&gt;.
- monoisotopicMolecularWeight: The monoisotopic mass is the sum of the masses of the atoms in a molecule using the unbound, ground-state, rest mass of the principal (most abundant) isotope for each element instead of the isotopic average mass. Please include the units in the form '&lt;Number&gt; &lt;unit&gt;', for example '770.230488 g/mol' or as '&lt;QuantitativeValue&gt;.
- smiles: A specification in form of a line notation for describing the structure of chemical species using short ASCII strings.  Double bond stereochemistry \ indicators may need to be escaped in the string in formats where the backslash is an escape character.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface MolecularEntity {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'MolecularEntity'
  inChI?: string
  inChIKey?: string
  iupacName?: string
  molecularFormula?: string
  molecularWeight?: QuantitativeValue | string
  monoisotopicMolecularWeight?: QuantitativeValue | string
  smiles?: string
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "MolecularEntity",
  "name": "Example MolecularEntity",
  "description": "An example of the MolecularEntity type",
  "url": "https://example.com/molecularentity",
  "identifier": "example-molecularentity-1"
}
```

## Notes

- MolecularEntity inherits all properties from BioChemEntity
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
