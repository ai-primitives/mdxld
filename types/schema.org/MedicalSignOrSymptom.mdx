# MedicalSignOrSymptom

Any feature associated or not with a medical condition. In medicine a symptom is generally subjective while a sign is objective.

## Type Hierarchy

MedicalSignOrSymptom is a type of MedicalCondition.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from MedicalSignOrSymptom:

- MedicalSign: Any physical manifestation of a person's medical condition discoverable by objective diagnostic tests or physical examination.
- MedicalSymptom: Any complaint sensed and expressed by the patient (therefore defined as subjective)  like stomachache, lower-back pain, or fatigue.
