title: BreadcrumbList
description: A BreadcrumbList is an ItemList consisting of a chain of linked Web pages, typically described using at least their URL and their name, and typically ending with the current page.\n\nThe [[position]] property is used to reconstruct the order of the items in a BreadcrumbList. The convention is that a breadcrumb list has an [[itemListOrder]] of [[ItemListOrderAscending]] (lower values listed first), and that the first items in this list correspond to the "top" or beginning of the breadcrumb trail, e.g. with a site or section homepage. The specific values of 'position' are not assigned meaning for a BreadcrumbList, but they should be integers, e.g. beginning with '1' for the first item in the list.

# BreadcrumbList

A BreadcrumbList is an ItemList consisting of a chain of linked Web pages, typically described using at least their URL and their name, and typically ending with the current page.\n\nThe [[position]] property is used to reconstruct the order of the items in a BreadcrumbList. The convention is that a breadcrumb list has an [[itemListOrder]] of [[ItemListOrderAscending]] (lower values listed first), and that the first items in this list correspond to the "top" or beginning of the breadcrumb trail, e.g. with a site or section homepage. The specific values of 'position' are not assigned meaning for a BreadcrumbList, but they should be integers, e.g. beginning with '1' for the first item in the list.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface BreadcrumbList extends ItemList {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'BreadcrumbList'

}
```
