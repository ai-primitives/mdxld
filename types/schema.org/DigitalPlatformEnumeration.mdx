# DigitalPlatformEnumeration

Enumerates some common technology platforms, for use with properties such as [[actionPlatform]].

These codes are at a fairly high level and do not deal with versioning and other nuance. Additional codes can be suggested [in github](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/3057).
