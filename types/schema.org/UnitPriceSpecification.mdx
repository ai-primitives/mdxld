# UnitPriceSpecification

The price asked for a given offer by the respective organization or person.

## Type Hierarchy

UnitPriceSpecification is a type of PriceSpecification.

### Direct Subtypes

No types directly inherit from UnitPriceSpecification.

## Properties

UnitPriceSpecification defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from PriceSpecification:

- billingDuration: Specifies for how long this price (or price component) will be billed. Can be used, for example, to model the contractual duration of a subscription or payment plan. Type can be either a Duration or a Number (in which case the unit of measurement, for example month, is specified by the unitCode property).
- billingIncrement: This property specifies the minimal quantity and rounding increment that will be the basis for the billing. The unit of measurement is specified by the unitCode property.
- billingStart: Specifies after how much time this price (or price component) becomes valid and billing starts. Can be used, for example, to model a price increase after the first year of a subscription. The unit of measurement is specified by the unitCode property.
- priceComponentType: Identifies a price component (for example, a line item on an invoice), part of the total price for an offer.
- referenceQuantity: The reference quantity for which a certain price applies, e.g. 1 EUR per 4 kWh of electricity. This property is a replacement for unitOfMeasurement for the advanced cases where the price does not relate to a standard unit.
