      type: PriceComponentTypeEnumeration
      description: Identifies a price component (for example, a line item on an invoice), part of the total price for an offer.
    - name: priceType
      type: PriceTypeEnumeration | string
      description: Defines the type of a price specified for an offered product, for example a list price, a (temporary) sale price or a manufacturer suggested retail price. If multiple prices are specified for an offer the [[priceType]] property can be used to identify the type of each such specified price. The value of priceType can be specified as a value from enumeration PriceTypeEnumeration or as a free form text string for price types that are not already predefined in PriceTypeEnumeration.
    - name: unitCode
      type: string
      description: The unit of measurement given using the UN/CEFACT Common Code (3 characters) or a URL. Other codes than the UN/CEFACT Common Code may be used with a prefix followed by a colon.
    - name: referenceQuantity
      type: QuantitativeValue
      description: The reference quantity for which a certain price applies, e.g. 1 EUR per 4 kWh of electricity. This property is a replacement for unitOfMeasurement for the advanced cases where the price does not relate to a standard unit.
    - name: billingIncrement
      type: number
      description: This property specifies the minimal quantity and rounding increment that will be the basis for the billing. The unit of measurement is specified by the unitCode property.
    - name: billingDuration
      type: Duration | QuantitativeValue | number
      description: Specifies for how long this price (or price component) will be billed. Can be used, for example, to model the contractual duration of a subscription or payment plan. Type can be either a Duration or a Number (in which case the unit of measurement, for example month, is specified by the unitCode property).
    - name: billingStart
      type: number
      description: Specifies after how much time this price (or price component) becomes valid and billing starts. Can be used, for example, to model a price increase after the first year of a subscription. The unit of measurement is specified by the unitCode property.
    - name: unitText
      type: string
      description: A string or text indicating the unit of measurement. Useful if you cannot provide a standard unit code for

(Unicode 'FULL STOP' (U+002E)) rather than ',' to indicate a decimal point. Avoid using these symbols as a readability separator.\n* Note that both [RDFa](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/#using-the-content-attribute) and Microdata syntax allow the use of a "content=" attribute for publishing simple machine-readable values alongside more human-friendly formatting.\n* Use values from 0123456789 (Unicode 'DIGIT ZERO' (U+0030) to 'DIGIT NINE' (U+0039)) rather than superficially similar Unicode symbols.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface UnitPriceSpecification extends PriceSpecification {
  $context?: 'schema.org'

  priceComponentType?: PriceComponentTypeEnumeration
  priceType?: PriceTypeEnumeration | string
  unitCode?: string
  referenceQuantity?: QuantitativeValue
  billingIncrement?: number
  billingDuration?: Duration | QuantitativeValue | number
  billingStart?: number
  unitText?: string
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "UnitPriceSpecification",

  "description": "An example of the UnitPriceSpecification type",
  "url": "https://example.com/unitpricespecification",
  "identifier": "example-unitpricespecification-1"
}
```

## Notes

- UnitPriceSpecification inherits all properties from PriceSpecification
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
