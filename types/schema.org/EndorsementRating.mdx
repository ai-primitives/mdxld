description: An EndorsementRating is a rating that expresses some level of endorsement, for example inclusion in a "critic's pick" blog, a
"Like" or "+1" on a social network. It can be considered the [[result]] of an [[EndorseAction]] in which the [[object]] of the action is rated positively by
some [[agent]]. As is common elsewhere in schema.org, it is sometimes more useful to describe the results of such an action without explicitly describing the [[Action]].

An [[EndorsementRating]] may be part of a numeric scale or organized system, but this is not required: having an explicit type for indicating a positive,
endorsement rating is particularly useful in the absence of numeric scales as it helps consumers understand that the rating is broadly positive.

# EndorsementRating

An EndorsementRating is a rating that expresses some level of endorsement, for example inclusion in a "critic's pick" blog, a
"Like" or "+1" on a social network. It can be considered the [[result]] of an [[EndorseAction]] in which the [[object]] of the action is rated positively by
some [[agent]]. As is common elsewhere in schema.org, it is sometimes more useful to describe the results of such an action without explicitly describing the [[Action]].

An [[EndorsementRating]] may be part of a numeric scale or organized system, but this is not required: having an explicit type for indicating a positive,
endorsement rating is particularly useful in the absence of numeric scales as it helps consumers understand that the rating is broadly positive.
