# PriceSpecification

A structured value representing a price or price range. Typically, only the subclasses of this type are used for markup. It is recommended to use [[MonetaryAmount]] to describe independent amounts of money such as a salary, credit card limits, etc.

## Type Hierarchy

PriceSpecification is a type of StructuredValue.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from PriceSpecification:

- CompoundPriceSpecification: A compound price specification is one that bundles multiple prices that all apply in combination for different dimensions of consumption. Use the name property of the attached unit price specification for indicating the dimension of a price component (e.g. "electricity" or "final cleaning").
- DeliveryChargeSpecification: The price for the delivery of an offer using a particular delivery method.
- PaymentChargeSpecification: The costs of settling the payment using a particular payment method.
- UnitPriceSpecification: The price asked for a given offer by the respective organization or person.

## Properties

### Direct Properties

- price: The offer price of a product, or of a price component when attached to PriceSpecification and its subtypes.\n\nUsage guidelines:\n\n* Use the [[priceCurrency]] property (with standard formats: [ISO 4217 currency format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217), e.g. "USD"; [Ticker symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptocurrencies) for cryptocurrencies, e.g. "BTC"; well known names for [Local Exchange Trading Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_exchange_trading_system) (LETS) and other currency types, e.g. "Ithaca HOUR") instead of including [ambiguous symbols](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_sign#Currencies_that_use_the_dollar_or_peso_sign) such as '$' in the value.\n* Use '.' (Unicode 'FULL STOP' (U+002E)) rather than ',' to indicate a decimal point. Avoid using these symbols as a readability separator.\n* Note that both [RDFa](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/#using-the-content-attribute) and Microdata syntax allow the use of a "content=" attribute for publishing simple machine-readable values alongside more human-friendly formatting.\n* Use values from 0123456789 (Unicode 'DIGIT ZERO' (U+0030) to 'DIGIT NINE' (U+0039)) rather than superficially similar Unicode symbols.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface PriceSpecification extends StructuredValue {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'PriceSpecification'
  price?: number | string
  membershipPointsEarned?: QuantitativeValue | number
  validForMemberTier?: MemberProgramTier
  valueAddedTaxIncluded?: boolean
  eligibleQuantity?: QuantitativeValue
  validThrough?: string
  priceCurrency?: string
  maxPrice?: number
  validFrom?: string
  minPrice?: number
  eligibleTransactionVolume?: PriceSpecification
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "PriceSpecification",
  "name": "Example PriceSpecification",
  "description": "An example of the PriceSpecification type",
  "url": "https://example.com/pricespecification",
  "identifier": "example-pricespecification-1"
}
```

## Notes

- PriceSpecification inherits all properties from StructuredValue
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
