# PriceSpecification

A structured value representing a price or price range. Typically, only the subclasses of this type are used for markup. It is recommended to use [[MonetaryAmount]] to describe independent amounts of money such as a salary, credit card limits, etc.

## Type Hierarchy

PriceSpecification is a type of StructuredValue.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from PriceSpecification:

- CompoundPriceSpecification: A compound price specification is one that bundles multiple prices that all apply in combination for different dimensions of consumption. Use the name property of the attached unit price specification for indicating the dimension of a price component (e.g. "electricity" or "final cleaning").
- DeliveryChargeSpecification: The price for the delivery of an offer using a particular delivery method.
- PaymentChargeSpecification: The costs of settling the payment using a particular payment method.
- UnitPriceSpecification: The price asked for a given offer by the respective organization or person.

## Properties

PriceSpecification defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from StructuredValue:

- maxPrice: The highest price if the price is a range.
- minPrice: The lowest price if the price is a range.
- valueAddedTaxIncluded: Specifies whether the applicable value-added tax (VAT) is included in the price specification or not.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface PriceSpecification {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'PriceSpecification'
  maxPrice?: number
  minPrice?: number
  valueAddedTaxIncluded?: boolean
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "PriceSpecification",
  "name": "Example PriceSpecification",
  "description": "An example of the PriceSpecification type",
  "url": "https://example.com/pricespecification",
  "identifier": "example-pricespecification-1"
}
```

- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
