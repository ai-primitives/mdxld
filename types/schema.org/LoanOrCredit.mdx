## Type Hierarchy

## Properties

LoanOrCredit defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from FinancialProduct:

- gracePeriod: The period of time after any due date that the borrower has to fulfil its obligations before a default (failure to pay) is deemed to have occurred.
- loanRepaymentForm: A form of paying back money previously borrowed from a lender. Repayment usually takes the form of periodic payments that normally include part principal plus interest in each payment.
