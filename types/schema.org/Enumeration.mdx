      type: string
      description: An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the
    use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference. In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org <a href="https://schema.org/docs/styleguide.html">style guide</a>.

# Enumeration

Lists or enumerations—for example, a list of cuisines or music genres, etc.

## Type Hierarchy

Enumeration is a type of Intangible.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from Enumeration:

- AdultOrientedEnumeration: Enumeration of considerations that make a product relevant or potentially restricted for adults only.
- BoardingPolicyType: A type of boarding policy used by an airline.
- BookFormatType: The publication format of the book.
- BusinessEntityType: A business entity type is a conceptual entity representing the legal form, the size, the main line of business, the position in the value chain, or any combination thereof, of an organization or business person.\n\nCommonly used values:\n\n* http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#Business\n* http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#Enduser\n* http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#PublicInstitution\n* http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#Reseller
    
- BusinessFunction: The business function specifies the type of activity or access (i.e., the bundle of rights) offered by the organization or business person through the offer. Typical are sell, rental or lease, maintenance or repair, manufacture / produce, recycle / dispose, engineering / construction, or installation. Proprietary specifications of access rights are also instances of this class.\n\nCommonly used values:\n\n* http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#ConstructionInstallation\n* http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#Dispose\n* http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#LeaseOut\n* http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#Maintain\n* http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#ProvideService\n* http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#Repair\n* http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#Sell\n* http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#Buy

- CertificationStatusEnumeration: Enumerates the different statuses of a Certification (Active and Inactive).
- ContactPointOption: Enumerated options related to a ContactPoint.
- DayOfWeek: The day of the week, e.g. used to specify to which day the opening hours of an OpeningHoursSpecification refer.

Originally, URLs from [GoodRelations](http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1) were used (for [[Monday]], [[Tuesday]], [[Wednesday]], [[Thursday]], [[Friday]], [[Saturday]], [[Sunday]] plus a special entry for [[PublicHolidays]]); these have now been integrated directly into schema.org.
      
- DeliveryMethod: A delivery method is a standardized procedure for transferring the product or service to the destination of fulfillment chosen by the customer. Delivery methods are characterized by the means of transportation used, and by the organization or group that is the contracting party for the sending organization or person.\n\nCommonly used values:\n\n* http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#DeliveryModeDirectDownload\n* http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#DeliveryModeFreight\n* http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#DeliveryModeMail\n* http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#DeliveryModeOwnFleet\n* http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#DeliveryModePickUp\n* http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#DHL\n* http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#FederalExpress\n* http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#UPS
        
- DigitalDocumentPermissionType: A type of permission which can be granted for accessing a digital document.
- DigitalPlatformEnumeration: Enumerates some common technology platforms, for use with properties such as [[actionPlatform]]. It is not supposed to be comprehensive - when a suitable code is not enumerated here, textual or URL values can be used instead. These codes are at a fairly high level and do not deal with versioning and other nuance. Additional codes can be suggested [in github](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/3057). 
- EnergyEfficiencyEnumeration: Enumerates energy efficiency levels (also known as "classes" or "ratings") and certifications that are part of several international energy efficiency standards.
- EventAttendanceModeEnumeration: An EventAttendanceModeEnumeration value is one of potentially several modes of organising an event, relating to whether it is online or offline.
- GameAvailabilityEnumeration: For a [[VideoGame]], such as used with a [[PlayGameAction]], an enumeration of the kind of game availability offered. 
- GamePlayMode: Indicates whether this game is multi-player, co-op or single-player.
- GenderType: An enumeration of genders.
- GovernmentBenefitsType: GovernmentBenefitsType enumerates several kinds of government benefits to support the COVID-19 situation. Note that this structure may not capture all benefits offered.
- HealthAspectEnumeration: HealthAspectEnumeration enumerates several aspects of health content online, each of which might be described using [[hasHealthAspect]] and [[HealthTopicContent]].
- ItemAvailability: A list of possible product availability options.
- ItemListOrderType: Enumerated for values for itemListOrder for indicating how an ordered ItemList is organized.
- LegalValueLevel: A list of possible levels for the legal validity of a legislation.
- MapCategoryType: An enumeration of several kinds of Map.
- MeasurementMethodEnum: Enumeration(s) for use with [[measurementMethod]].
- MeasurementTypeEnumeration: Enumeration of common measurement types (or dimensions), for example "chest" for a person, "inseam" for pants, "gauge" for screws, or "wheel" for bicycles.
- MediaEnumeration: MediaEnumeration enumerations are lists of codes, labels etc. useful for describing media objects. They may be reflections of externally developed lists, or created at schema.org, or a combination.
- MediaManipulationRatingEnumeration:  Codes for use with the [[mediaAuthenticityCategory]] property, indicating the authenticity of a media object (in the context of how it was published or shared). In general these codes are not mutually exclusive, although some combinations (such as 'original' versus 'transformed', 'edited' and 'staged') would be contradictory if applied in the same [[MediaReview]]. Note that the application of these codes is with regard to a piece of media shared or published in a particular context.
- MedicalEnumeration: Enumerations related to health and the practice of medicine: A concept that is used to attribute a quality to another concept, as a qualifier, a collection of items or a listing of all of the elements of a set in medicine practice.

         (inherited from Thing)
- subjectOf: A CreativeWork or Event about this Thing. (inherited from Thing)
- description: A description of the item. (inherited from Thing)
- additionalType: An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax.

In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org <a href="https://schema.org/docs/styleguide.html">style guide</a>. (inherited from Thing)
- image: An image of the item. This can be a [[URL]] or a fully described [[ImageObject]]. (inherited from Thing)
- sameAs: URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website. (inherited from Thing)

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface Enumeration extends Intangible {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'Enumeration'
  supersededBy?: Class | Enumeration | Property
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "Enumeration",
  "name": "Example Enumeration",
  "description": "An example of the Enumeration type",
  "url": "https://example.com/enumeration",
  "identifier": "example-enumeration-1"
}
```

## Notes

- Enumeration inherits all properties from Intangible
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
