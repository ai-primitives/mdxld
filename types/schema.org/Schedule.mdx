# Schedule

A schedule defines a repeating time period used to describe a regularly occurring [[Event]]. At a minimum a schedule will specify [[repeatFrequency]] which describes the interval between occurrences of the event. Additional information can be provided to specify the schedule more precisely.
      This includes identifying the day(s) of the week or month when the recurring event will take place, in addition to its start and end time. Schedules may also
      have start and end dates to indicate when they are active, e.g. to define a limited calendar of events.

## Type Hierarchy

Schedule is a type of Intangible.

### Direct Subtypes

No types directly inherit from Schedule.

## Properties

Schedule defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from Intangible:

- byDay: Defines the day(s) of the week on which a recurring [[Event]] takes place. May be specified using either [[DayOfWeek]], or alternatively [[Text]] conforming to iCal's syntax for byDay recurrence rules.
- byMonth: Defines the month(s) of the year on which a recurring [[Event]] takes place. Specified as an [[Integer]] between 1-12. January is 1.
- byMonthDay: Defines the day(s) of the month on which a recurring [[Event]] takes place. Specified as an [[Integer]] between 1-31.
- byMonthWeek: Defines the week(s) of the month on which a recurring Event takes place. Specified as an Integer between 1-5. For clarity, byMonthWeek is best used in conjunction with byDay to indicate concepts like the first and third Mondays of a month.
- exceptDate: Defines a [[Date]] or [[DateTime]] during which a scheduled [[Event]] will not take place. The property allows exceptions to
      a [[Schedule]] to be specified. If an exception is specified as a [[DateTime]] then only the event that would have started at that specific date and time
      should be excluded from the schedule. If an exception is specified as a [[Date]] then any event that is scheduled for that 24 hour period should be
      excluded from the schedule. This allows a whole day to be excluded from the schedule without having to itemise every scheduled event.
- repeatCount: Defines the number of times a recurring [[Event]] will take place.
- repeatFrequency: Defines the frequency at which [[Event]]s will occur according to a schedule [[Schedule]]. The intervals between
      events should be defined as a [[Duration]] of time.
- scheduleTimezone: Indicates the timezone for which the time(s) indicated in the [[Schedule]] are given. The value provided should be among those listed in the IANA Time Zone Database.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface Schedule {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'Schedule'
  byDay?: DayOfWeek | string
  byMonth?: number
  byMonthDay?: number
  byMonthWeek?: number
  exceptDate?: string
  repeatCount?: number
  repeatFrequency?: Duration | string
  scheduleTimezone?: string
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "Schedule",
  "name": "Example Schedule",
  "description": "An example of the Schedule type",
  "url": "https://example.com/schedule",
  "identifier": "example-schedule-1"
}
```

## Notes

- Schedule inherits all properties from Intangible
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
