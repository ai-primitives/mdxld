# Dataset

A body of structured information describing some topic(s) of interest.

## Type Hierarchy

Dataset is a type of CreativeWork.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from Dataset:

- DataFeed: A single feed providing structured information about one or more entities or topics.

## Properties

Dataset defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from CreativeWork:

- catalog: A data catalog which contains this dataset.
- datasetTimeInterval: The range of temporal applicability of a dataset, e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 (in ISO 8601 time interval format).
- distribution: A downloadable form of this dataset, at a specific location, in a specific format. This property can be repeated if different variations are available. There is no expectation that different downloadable distributions must contain exactly equivalent information (see also [DCAT](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Class:Distribution) on this point). Different distributions might include or exclude different subsets of the entire dataset, for example.
- includedDataCatalog: A data catalog which contains this dataset (this property was previously 'catalog', preferred name is now 'includedInDataCatalog').
- includedInDataCatalog: A data catalog which contains this dataset.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface Dataset {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'Dataset'
  catalog?: DataCatalog
  datasetTimeInterval?: string
  distribution?: DataDownload
  includedDataCatalog?: DataCatalog
  includedInDataCatalog?: DataCatalog
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "Dataset",
  "name": "Example Dataset",
  "description": "An example of the Dataset type",
  "url": "https://example.com/dataset",
  "identifier": "example-dataset-1"
}
```

## Notes

- Dataset inherits all properties from CreativeWork
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
