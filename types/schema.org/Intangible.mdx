# Intangible

A utility class that serves as the umbrella for a number of 'intangible' things such as quantities, structured values, etc.

## Type Hierarchy

Intangible is a type of Thing.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from Intangible:

- ActionAccessSpecification: A set of requirements that must be fulfilled in order to perform an Action.
- AlignmentObject: An intangible item that describes an alignment between a learning resource and a node in an educational framework.

Should not be used where the nature of the alignment can be described using a simple property, for example to express that a resource [[teaches]] or [[assesses]] a competency.
- Audience: Intended audience for an item, i.e. the group for whom the item was created.
- BedDetails: An entity holding detailed information about the available bed types, e.g. the quantity of twin beds for a hotel room. For the single case of just one bed of a certain type, you can use bed directly with a text. See also [[BedType]] (under development).
- Brand: A brand is a name used by an organization or business person for labeling a product, product group, or similar.
- BroadcastChannel: A unique instance of a BroadcastService on a CableOrSatelliteService lineup.
- BroadcastFrequencySpecification: The frequency in MHz and the modulation used for a particular BroadcastService.
- Class: A class, also often called a 'Type'; equivalent to rdfs:Class.
- ComputerLanguage: This type covers computer programming languages such as Scheme and Lisp, as well as other language-like computer representations. Natural languages are best represented with the [[Language]] type.
- ConstraintNode: The ConstraintNode type is provided to support usecases in which a node in a structured data graph is described with properties which appear to describe a single entity, but are being used in a situation where they serve a more abstract purpose. A [[ConstraintNode]] can be described using [[constraintProperty]] and [[numConstraints]]. These constraint properties can serve a
    variety of purposes, and their values may sometimes be understood to indicate sets of possible values rather than single, exact and specific values.
- DataFeedItem: A single item within a larger data feed.
- DefinedTerm: A word, name, acronym, phrase, etc. with a formal definition. Often used in the context of category or subject classification, glossaries or dictionaries, product or creative work types, etc. Use the name property for the term being defined, use termCode if the term has an alpha-numeric code allocated, use description to provide the definition of the term.
- Demand: A demand entity represents the public, not necessarily binding, not necessarily exclusive, announcement by an organization or person to seek a certain type of goods or services. For describing demand using this type, the very same properties used for Offer apply.
- DigitalDocumentPermission: A permission for a particular person or group to access a particular file.
- EducationalOccupationalProgram: A program offered by an institution which determines the learning progress to achieve an outcome, usually a credential like a degree or certificate. This would define a discrete set of opportunities (e.g., job, courses) that together constitute a program with a clear start, end, set of requirements, and transition to a new occupational opportunity (e.g., a job), or sometimes a higher educational opportunity (e.g., an advanced degree).
- EnergyConsumptionDetails: EnergyConsumptionDetails represents information related to the energy efficiency of a product that consumes energy. The information that can be provided is based on international regulations such as for example [EU directive 2017/1369](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2017/1369/oj) for energy labeling and the [Energy labeling rule](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/energy-water-use-labeling-consumer) under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) in the US.
- EntryPoint: An entry point, within some Web-based protocol.
- Enumeration: Lists or enumerations—for example, a list of cuisines or music genres, etc.
- FloorPlan: A FloorPlan is an explicit representation of a collection of similar accommodations, allowing the provision of common information (room counts, sizes, layout diagrams) and offers for rental or sale. In typical use, some [[ApartmentComplex]] has an [[accommodationFloorPlan]] which is a [[FloorPlan]].  A FloorPlan is always in the context of a particular place, either a larger [[ApartmentComplex]] or a single [[Apartment]]. The visual/spatial aspects of a floor plan (i.e. room layout, [see wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_plan)) can be indicated using [[image]]. 
- GameServer: Server that provides game interaction in a multiplayer game.
- GeospatialGeometry: (Eventually to be defined as) a supertype of GeoShape designed to accommodate definitions from Geo-Spatial best practices.
- Grant: A grant, typically financial or otherwise quantifiable, of resources. Typically a [[funder]] sponsors some [[MonetaryAmount]] to an [[Organization]] or [[Person]],
    sometimes not necessarily via a dedicated or long-lived [[Project]], resulting in one or more outputs, or [[fundedItem]]s. For financial sponsorship, indicate the [[funder]] of a [[MonetaryGrant]]. For non-financial support, indicate [[sponsor]] of [[Grant]]s of resources (e.g. office space).

Grants support  activities directed towards some agreed collective goals, often but not always organized as [[Project]]s. Long-lived projects are sometimes sponsored by a variety of grants over time, but it is also common for a project to be associated with a single grant.

The amount of a [[Grant]] is represented using [[amount]] as a [[MonetaryAmount]].
    
- HealthInsurancePlan: A US-style health insurance plan, including PPOs, EPOs, and HMOs.
- HealthPlanCostSharingSpecification: A description of costs to the patient under a given network or formulary.
- HealthPlanFormulary: For a given health insurance plan, the specification for costs and coverage of prescription drugs.
- HealthPlanNetwork: A US-style health insurance plan network.
- Invoice: A statement of the money due for goods or services; a bill.
- ItemList: A list of items of any sort&#x2014;for example, Top 10 Movies About Weathermen, or Top 100 Party Songs. Not to be confused with HTML lists, which are often used only for formatting.
- JobPosting: A listing that describes a job opening in a certain organization.
- Language: Natural languages such as Spanish, Tamil, Hindi, English, etc. Formal language code tags expressed in [BCP 47](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag) can be used via the [[alternateName]] property. The Language type previously also covered programming languages such as Scheme and Lisp, which are now best represented using [[ComputerLanguage]].
- ListItem: An list item, e.g. a step in a checklist or how-to description.
- MediaSubscription: A subscription which allows a user to access media including audio, video, books, etc.
- MemberProgram: A MemberProgram defines a loyalty (or membership) program that provides its members with certain benefits, for example better pricing, free shipping or returns, or the ability to earn loyalty points. Member programs may have multiple tiers, for example silver and gold members, each with different benefits.
- MemberProgramTier: A MemberProgramTier specifies a tier under a loyalty (member) program, for example "gold".
- MenuItem: A food or drink item listed in a menu or menu section.
- MerchantReturnPolicy: A MerchantReturnPolicy provides information about product return policies associated with an [[Organization]], [[Product]], or [[Offer]].
- MerchantReturnPolicySeasonalOverride: A seasonal override of a return policy, for example used for holidays.
- Occupation: A profession, may involve prolonged training and/or a formal qualification.
- OccupationalExperienceRequirements: Indicates employment-related experience requirements, e.g. [[monthsOfExperience]].
- Offer: An offer to transfer some rights to an item or to provide a service — for example, an offer to sell tickets to an event, to rent the DVD of a movie, to stream a TV show over the internet, to repair a motorcycle, or to loan a book.\n\nNote: As the [[businessFunction]] property, which identifies the form of offer (e.g. sell, lease, repair, dispose), defaults to http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#Sell; an Offer without a defined businessFunction value can be assumed to be an offer to sell.\n\nFor [GTIN](http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/idkeys/gtin)-related fields, see [Check Digit calculator](http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/support/check_digit_calculator) and [validation guide](http://www.gs1us.org/resources/standards/gtin-validation-guide) from [GS1](http://www.gs1.org/).
- Order: An order is a confirmation of a transaction (a receipt), which can contain multiple line items, each represented by an Offer that has been accepted by the customer.
- OrderItem: An order item is a line of an order. It includes the quantity and shipping details of a bought offer.
- ParcelDelivery: The delivery of a parcel either via the postal service or a commercial service.
- PaymentMethod: A payment method is a standardized procedure for transferring the monetary amount for a purchase. Payment methods are characterized by the legal and technical structures used, and by the organization or group carrying out the transaction. The following legacy values should be accepted:
    \n\n* http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#ByBankTransferInAdvance\n* http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#ByInvoice\n* http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#Cash\n* http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#CheckInAdvance\n* http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#COD\n* http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#DirectDebit\n* http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#GoogleCheckout\n* http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#PayPal\n* http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#PaySwarm\n\nStructured values are recommended for newer payment methods.
- Permit: A permit issued by an organization, e.g. a parking pass.
- ProgramMembership: Used to describe membership in a loyalty programs (e.g. "StarAliance"), traveler clubs (e.g. "AAA"), purchase clubs ("Safeway Club"), etc.
- Property: A property, used to indicate attributes and relationships of some Thing; equivalent to rdf:Property.
- PropertyValueSpecification: A Property value specification.
- Quantity: Quantities such as distance, time, mass, weight, etc. Particular instances of say Mass are entities like '3 kg' or '4 milligrams'.
- Rating: A rating is an evaluation on a numeric scale, such as 1 to 5 stars.
- Reservation: Describes a reservation for travel, dining or an event. Some reservations require tickets. \n\nNote: This type is for information about actual reservations, e.g. in confirmation emails or HTML pages with individual confirmations of reservations. For offers of tickets, restaurant reservations, flights, or rental cars, use [[Offer]].
- Role: Represents additional information about a relationship or property. For example a Role can be used to say that a 'member' role linking some SportsTeam to a player occurred during a particular time period. Or that a Person's 'actor' role in a Movie was for some particular characterName. Such properties can be attached to a Role entity, which is then associated with the main entities using ordinary properties like 'member' or 'actor'.\n\nSee also [blog post](http://blog.schema.org/2014/06/introducing-role.html).
- Schedule: A schedule defines a repeating time period used to describe a regularly occurring [[Event]]. At a minimum a schedule will specify [[repeatFrequency]] which describes the interval between occurrences of the event. Additional information can be provided to specify the schedule more precisely.
      This includes identifying the day(s) of the week or month when the recurring event will take place, in addition to its start and end time. Schedules may also
      have start and end dates to indicate when they are active, e.g. to define a limited calendar of events.
- Seat: Used to describe a seat, such as a reserved seat in an event reservation.
- Series: A Series in schema.org is a group of related items, typically but not necessarily of the same kind. See also [[CreativeWorkSeries]], [[EventSeries]].
- Service: A service provided by an organization, e.g. delivery service, print services, etc.
- ServiceChannel: A means for accessing a service, e.g. a government office location, web site, or phone number.
- SpeakableSpecification: A SpeakableSpecification indicates (typically via [[xpath]] or [[cssSelector]]) sections of a document that are highlighted as particularly [[speakable]]. Instances of this type are expected to be used primarily as values of the [[speakable]] property.
- StatisticalPopulation: A StatisticalPopulation is a set of instances of a certain given type that satisfy some set of constraints. The property [[populationType]] is used to specify the type. Any property that can be used on instances of that type can appear on the statistical population. For example, a [[StatisticalPopulation]] representing all [[Person]]s with a [[homeLocation]] of East Podunk California would be described by applying the appropriate [[homeLocation]] and [[populationType]] properties to a [[StatisticalPopulation]] item that stands for that set of people.
The properties [[numConstraints]] and [[constraintProperty]] are used to specify which of the populations properties are used to specify the population. Note that the sense of "population" used here is the general sense of a statistical
population, and does not imply that the population consists of people. For example, a [[populationType]] of [[Event]] or [[NewsArticle]] could be used. See also [[Observation]], where a [[populationType]] such as [[Person]] or [[Event]] can be indicated directly. In most cases it may be better to use [[StatisticalVariable]] instead of [[StatisticalPopulation]].
- StructuredValue: Structured values are used when the value of a property has a more complex structure than simply being a textual value or a reference to another thing.
- Ticket: Used to describe a ticket to an event, a flight, a bus ride, etc.
- Trip: A trip or journey. An itinerary of visits to one or more places.
- VirtualLocation: An online or virtual location for attending events. For example, one may attend an online seminar or educational event. While a virtual location may be used as the location of an event, virtual locations should not be confused with physical locations in the real world.
