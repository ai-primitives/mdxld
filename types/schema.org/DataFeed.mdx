# DataFeed

A single feed providing structured information about one or more entities or topics.

## Type Hierarchy

DataFeed is a type of Dataset.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from DataFeed:

- CompleteDataFeed: A [[CompleteDataFeed]] is a [[DataFeed]] whose standard representation includes content for every item currently in the feed.

This is the equivalent of Atom's element as defined in Feed Paging and Archiving [RFC 5005](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5005), for example (and as defined for Atom), when using data from a feed that represents a collection of items that varies over time (e.g. "Top Twenty Records") there is no need to have newer entries mixed in alongside older, obsolete entries. By marking this feed as a CompleteDataFeed, old entries can be safely discarded when the feed is refreshed, since we can assume the feed has provided descriptions for all current items.

## Properties

DataFeed defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from Dataset:

- dataFeedElement: An item within a data feed. Data feeds may have many elements.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface DataFeed {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'DataFeed'
  dataFeedElement?: DataFeedItem | Thing | string
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "DataFeed",
  "name": "Example DataFeed",
  "description": "An example of the DataFeed type",
  "url": "https://example.com/datafeed",
  "identifier": "example-datafeed-1"
}
```

## Notes

- DataFeed inherits all properties from Dataset
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
