# Gene

A discrete unit of inheritance which affects one or more biological traits (Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene)). Examples include FOXP2 (Forkhead box protein P2), SCARNA21 (small Cajal body-specific RNA 21), A- (agouti genotype).

## Type Hierarchy

Gene is a type of BioChemEntity.

### Direct Subtypes

No types directly inherit from Gene.

## Properties

Gene defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from BioChemEntity:

- alternativeOf: Another gene which is a variation of this one.
- encodesBioChemEntity: Another BioChemEntity encoded by this one. 
- expressedIn: Tissue, organ, biological sample, etc in which activity of this gene has been observed experimentally. For example brain, digestive system.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface Gene {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'Gene'
  alternativeOf?: Gene
  encodesBioChemEntity?: BioChemEntity
  expressedIn?: AnatomicalStructure | AnatomicalSystem | BioChemEntity | DefinedTerm
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "Gene",
  "name": "Example Gene",
  "description": "An example of the Gene type",
  "url": "https://example.com/gene",
  "identifier": "example-gene-1"
}
```

## Notes

- Gene inherits all properties from BioChemEntity
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
