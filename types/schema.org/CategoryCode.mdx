## Usage Example

```typescript
interface CategoryCode extends DefinedTerm {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'CategoryCode'
  inCodeSet?: CategoryCodeSet | string
  codeValue?: string
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "CategoryCode",
  "name": "Example CategoryCode",
  "description": "An example of the CategoryCode type",
  "url": "https://example.com/categorycode",
  "identifier": "example-categorycode-1"
}
```

## Notes

- CategoryCode inherits all properties from DefinedTerm
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
