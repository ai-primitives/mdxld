## Usage Example

```typescript
interface QuantitativeValueDistribution extends StructuredValue {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'QuantitativeValueDistribution'
  percentile90?: number
  percentile10?: number
  median?: number
  duration?: Duration
  percentile75?: number
  percentile25?: number
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "QuantitativeValueDistribution",
