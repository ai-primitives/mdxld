# BroadcastFrequencySpecification

The frequency in MHz and the modulation used for a particular BroadcastService.

## Type Hierarchy

BroadcastFrequencySpecification is a type of Intangible.

### Direct Subtypes

No types directly inherit from BroadcastFrequencySpecification.

## Properties

BroadcastFrequencySpecification defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from Intangible:

- broadcastFrequencyValue: The frequency in MHz for a particular broadcast.
- broadcastSignalModulation: The modulation (e.g. FM, AM, etc) used by a particular broadcast service.
- broadcastSubChannel: The subchannel used for the broadcast.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface BroadcastFrequencySpecification {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'BroadcastFrequencySpecification'
  broadcastFrequencyValue?: QuantitativeValue | number
  broadcastSignalModulation?: QualitativeValue | string
  broadcastSubChannel?: string
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "BroadcastFrequencySpecification",
  "name": "Example BroadcastFrequencySpecification",
  "description": "An example of the BroadcastFrequencySpecification type",
  "url": "https://example.com/broadcastfrequencyspecification",
  "identifier": "example-broadcastfrequencyspecification-1"
}
```

## Notes

- BroadcastFrequencySpecification inherits all properties from Intangible
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
