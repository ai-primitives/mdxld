# MedicalCondition

Any condition of the human body that affects the normal functioning of a person, whether physically or mentally. Includes diseases, injuries, disabilities, disorders, syndromes, etc.

## Type Hierarchy

MedicalCondition is a type of MedicalEntity.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from MedicalCondition:

- InfectiousDisease: An infectious disease is a clinically evident human disease resulting from the presence of pathogenic microbial agents, like pathogenic viruses, pathogenic bacteria, fungi, protozoa, multicellular parasites, and prions. To be considered an infectious disease, such pathogens are known to be able to cause this disease.
- MedicalSignOrSymptom: Any feature associated or not with a medical condition. In medicine a symptom is generally subjective while a sign is objective.

## Properties

### Direct Properties

- pathophysiology: Changes in the normal mechanical, physical, and biochemical functions that are associated with this activity or condition.
- possibleComplication: A possible unexpected and unfavorable evolution of a medical condition. Complications may include worsening of the signs or symptoms of the disease, extension of the condition to other organ systems, etc.
- possibleTreatment: A possible treatment to address this condition, sign or symptom.
- expectedPrognosis: The likely outcome in either the short term or long term of the medical condition.
- secondaryPrevention: A preventative therapy used to prevent reoccurrence of the medical condition after an initial episode of the condition.
- stage: The stage of the condition, if applicable.
- typicalTest: A medical test typically performed given this condition.
- drug: Specifying a drug or medicine used in a medication procedure.
- differentialDiagnosis: One of a set of differential diagnoses for the condition. Specifically, a closely-related or competing diagnosis typically considered later in the cognitive process whereby this medical condition is distinguished from others most likely responsible for a similar collection of signs and symptoms to reach the most parsimonious diagnosis or diagnoses in a patient.
- riskFactor: A modifiable or non-modifiable factor that increases the risk of a patient contracting this condition, e.g. age,  coexisting condition.
- associatedAnatomy: The anatomy of the underlying organ system or structures associated with this entity.
- signOrSymptom: A sign or symptom of this condition. Signs are objective or physically observable manifestations of the medical condition while symptoms are the subjective experience of the medical condition.
- status: The status of the study (enumerated).
- primaryPrevention: A preventative therapy used to prevent an initial occurrence of the medical condition, such as vaccination.
- naturalProgression: The expected progression of the condition if it is not treated and allowed to progress naturally.
