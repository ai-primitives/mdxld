# Place

Entities that have a somewhat fixed, physical extension.

## Type Hierarchy

Place is a type of Thing.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from Place:

- Accommodation: An accommodation is a place that can accommodate human beings, e.g. a hotel room, a camping pitch, or a meeting room. Many accommodations are for overnight stays, but this is not a mandatory requirement.
For more specific types of accommodations not defined in schema.org, one can use [[additionalType]] with external vocabularies.
<br /><br />
See also the <a href="/docs/hotels.html">dedicated document on the use of schema.org for marking up hotels and other forms of accommodations</a>.

- AdministrativeArea: A geographical region, typically under the jurisdiction of a particular government.
- CivicStructure: A public structure, such as a town hall or concert hall.
- Landform: A landform or physical feature.  Landform elements include mountains, plains, lakes, rivers, seascape and oceanic waterbody interface features such as bays, peninsulas, seas and so forth, including sub-aqueous terrain features such as submersed mountain ranges, volcanoes, and the great ocean basins.
- LandmarksOrHistoricalBuildings: An historical landmark or building.
- Residence: The place where a person lives.
- TouristAttraction: A tourist attraction.  In principle any Thing can be a [[TouristAttraction]], from a [[Mountain]] and [[LandmarksOrHistoricalBuildings]] to a [[LocalBusiness]].  This Type can be used on its own to describe a general [[TouristAttraction]], or be used as an [[additionalType]] to add tourist attraction properties to any other type.  (See examples below)
- TouristDestination: A tourist destination. In principle any [[Place]] can be a [[TouristDestination]] from a [[City]], Region or [[Country]] to an [[AmusementPark]] or [[Hotel]]. This Type can be used on its own to describe a general [[TouristDestination]], or be used as an [[additionalType]] to add tourist relevant properties to any other [[Place]].  A [[TouristDestination]] is defined as a [[Place]] that contains, or is colocated with, one or more [[TouristAttraction]]s, often linked by a similar theme or interest to a particular [[touristType]]. The [UNWTO](http://www2.unwto.org/) defines Destination (main destination of a tourism trip) as the place visited that is central to the decision to take the trip.
  (See examples below.)

## Properties

Place defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from Thing:

- branchCode: A short textual code (also called "store code") that uniquely identifies a place of business. The code is typically assigned by the parentOrganization and used in structured URLs.\n\nFor example, in the URL http://www.starbucks.co.uk/store-locator/etc/detail/3047 the code "3047" is a branchCode for a particular branch.
      
- containedIn: The basic containment relation between a place and one that contains it.
- containedInPlace: The basic containment relation between a place and one that contains it.
- containsPlace: The basic containment relation between a place and another that it contains.
- geo: The geo coordinates of the place.
- hasDriveThroughService: Indicates whether some facility (e.g. [[FoodEstablishment]], [[CovidTestingFacility]]) offers a service that can be used by driving through in a car. In the case of [[CovidTestingFacility]] such facilities could potentially help with social distancing from other potentially-infected users.
- hasMap: A URL to a map of the place.
- map: A URL to a map of the place.
- maps: A URL to a map of the place.
- openingHoursSpecification: The opening hours of a certain place.
- photo: A photograph of this place.
- photos: Photographs of this place.
- publicAccess: A flag to signal that the [[Place]] is open to public visitors.  If this property is omitted there is no assumed default boolean value.
- smokingAllowed: Indicates whether it is allowed to smoke in the place, e.g. in the restaurant, hotel or hotel room.
- specialOpeningHoursSpecification: The special opening hours of a certain place.\n\nUse this to explicitly override general opening hours brought in scope by [[openingHoursSpecification]] or [[openingHours]].
      

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface Place {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'Place'
  branchCode?: string
  containedIn?: Place
  containedInPlace?: Place
  containsPlace?: Place
  geo?: GeoCoordinates | GeoShape
  hasDriveThroughService?: boolean
  hasMap?: Map | string
  map?: string
  maps?: string
  openingHoursSpecification?: OpeningHoursSpecification
  photo?: ImageObject | Photograph
  photos?: ImageObject | Photograph
  publicAccess?: boolean
  smokingAllowed?: boolean
  specialOpeningHoursSpecification?: OpeningHoursSpecification
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "Place",
  "name": "Example Place",
  "description": "An example of the Place type",
  "url": "https://example.com/place",
  "identifier": "example-place-1"
}
```

## Notes

- Place inherits all properties from Thing
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
