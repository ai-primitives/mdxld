# Place

Entities that have a somewhat fixed, physical extension.

## Type Hierarchy

Place is a type of Thing.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from Place:

- Accommodation: An accommodation is a place that can accommodate human beings, e.g. a hotel room, a camping pitch, or a meeting room. Many accommodations are for overnight stays, but this is not a mandatory requirement.
For more specific types of accommodations not defined in schema.org, one can use [[additionalType]] with external vocabularies.
<br /><br />
See also the <a href="/docs/hotels.html">dedicated document on the use of schema.org for marking up hotels and other forms of accommodations</a>.

- AdministrativeArea: A geographical region, typically under the jurisdiction of a particular government.
- CivicStructure: A public structure, such as a town hall or concert hall.
- Landform: A landform or physical feature.  Landform elements include mountains, plains, lakes, rivers, seascape and oceanic waterbody interface features such as bays, peninsulas, seas and so forth, including sub-aqueous terrain features such as submersed mountain ranges, volcanoes, and the great ocean basins.
- LandmarksOrHistoricalBuildings: An historical landmark or building.
- Residence: The place where a person lives.
- TouristAttraction: A tourist attraction.  In principle any Thing can be a [[TouristAttraction]], from a [[Mountain]] and [[LandmarksOrHistoricalBuildings]] to a [[LocalBusiness]].  This Type can be used on its own to describe a general [[TouristAttraction]], or be used as an [[additionalType]] to add tourist attraction properties to any other type.  (See examples below)
- TouristDestination: A tourist destination. In principle any [[Place]] can be a [[TouristDestination]] from a [[City]], Region or [[Country]] to an [[AmusementPark]] or [[Hotel]]. This Type can be used on its own to describe a general [[TouristDestination]], or be used as an [[additionalType]] to add tourist relevant properties to any other [[Place]].  A [[TouristDestination]] is defined as a [[Place]] that contains, or is colocated with, one or more [[TouristAttraction]]s, often linked by a similar theme or interest to a particular [[touristType]]. The [UNWTO](http://www2.unwto.org/) defines Destination (main destination of a tourism trip) as the place visited that is central to the decision to take the trip.
  (See examples below.)
