## Type Hierarchy

Article is a type of CreativeWork.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from Article:

- AdvertiserContentArticle: An [[Article]] that an external entity has paid to place or to produce to its specifications. Includes [advertorials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertorial), sponsored content, native advertising and other paid content.
- NewsArticle: A NewsArticle is an article whose content reports news, or provides background context and supporting materials for understanding the news.

A more detailed overview of [schema.org News markup](/docs/news.html) is also available.

- Report: A Report generated by governmental or non-governmental organization.
- SatiricalArticle: An [[Article]] whose content is primarily [[satirical]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire) in nature, i.e. unlikely to be literally true. A satirical article is sometimes but not necessarily also a [[NewsArticle]]. [[ScholarlyArticle]]s are also sometimes satirized.
- ScholarlyArticle: A scholarly article.
- SocialMediaPosting: A post to a social media platform, including blog posts, tweets, Facebook posts, etc.
- TechArticle: A technical article - Example: How-to (task) topics, step-by-step, procedural troubleshooting, specifications, etc.

## Properties

Article defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from CreativeWork:

- articleBody: The actual body of the article.
- articleSection: Articles may belong to one or more 'sections' in a magazine or newspaper, such as Sports, Lifestyle, etc.
- backstory: For an [[Article]], typically a [[NewsArticle]], the backstory property provides a textual summary giving a brief explanation of why and how an article was created. In a journalistic setting this could include information about reporting process, methods, interviews, data sources, etc.
- wordCount: The number of words in the text of the Article.
