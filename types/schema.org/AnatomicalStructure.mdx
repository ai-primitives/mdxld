# AnatomicalStructure

Any part of the human body, typically a component of an anatomical system. Organs, tissues, and cells are all anatomical structures.

## Type Hierarchy

AnatomicalStructure is a type of MedicalEntity.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from AnatomicalStructure:

- Bone: Rigid connective tissue that comprises up the skeletal structure of the human body.
- BrainStructure: Any anatomical structure which pertains to the soft nervous tissue functioning as the coordinating center of sensation and intellectual and nervous activity.
- Joint: The anatomical location at which two or more bones make contact.
- Ligament: A short band of tough, flexible, fibrous connective tissue that functions to connect multiple bones, cartilages, and structurally support joints.
- Muscle: A muscle is an anatomical structure consisting of a contractile form of tissue that animals use to effect movement.
- Nerve: A common pathway for the electrochemical nerve impulses that are transmitted along each of the axons.
- Vessel: A component of the human body circulatory system comprised of an intricate network of hollow tubes that transport blood throughout the entire body.

## Properties

AnatomicalStructure defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from MedicalEntity:

- connectedTo: Other anatomical structures to which this structure is connected.
- diagram: An image containing a diagram that illustrates the structure and/or its component substructures and/or connections with other structures.
- partOfSystem: The anatomical or organ system that this structure is part of.
- subStructure: Component (sub-)structure(s) that comprise this anatomical structure.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface AnatomicalStructure {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'AnatomicalStructure'
  connectedTo?: AnatomicalStructure
  diagram?: ImageObject
  partOfSystem?: AnatomicalSystem
  subStructure?: AnatomicalStructure
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "AnatomicalStructure",
  "name": "Example AnatomicalStructure",
  "description": "An example of the AnatomicalStructure type",
  "url": "https://example.com/anatomicalstructure",
  "identifier": "example-anatomicalstructure-1"
}
```

## Notes

- AnatomicalStructure inherits all properties from MedicalEntity
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
