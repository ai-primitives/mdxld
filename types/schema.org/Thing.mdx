# Thing

The Thing type is the most generic type in Schema.org. All other types inherit from this base type.

## Properties

Thing serves as the base type and defines several core properties that are inherited by all other types:

- name: The name of the item
- description: A description of the item
- url: URL of the item
- identifier: The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of Thing
- image: An image of the item
- additionalType: An additional type for the item

## Usage

```typescript
interface Thing {
  $type: 'schema:Thing'
  name?: string
  description?: string
  url?: string
  identifier?: string | PropertyValue
  image?: ImageObject | URL | string
  additionalType?: URL | string
}
```

## Examples

```json
{
  "$type": "schema:Thing",
  "name": "Example Item",
  "description": "This is an example of the most basic Schema.org type",
  "url": "https://example.com/item"
}
```

## Related Types

As the root type, Thing is related to all other Schema.org types as they all inherit from it.

## Notes

- All Schema.org types extend Thing
- The properties defined on Thing are available on all other types
- When using Thing directly, consider if a more specific type would be more appropriate
