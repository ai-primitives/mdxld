      type: string
      description: An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the
    use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference. In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org <a href="https://schema.org/docs/styleguide.html">style guide</a>.

      type: ImageObject | string
      description: An image of the item. This can be a [[URL]] or a fully described [[ImageObject]].
    - name: sameAs
      type: string
      description: URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website.

      type: string
      description: An alias for the item.
    - name: mainEntityOfPage
      type: CreativeWork | string

# Thing

The most generic type of item.

## Type Hierarchy

Thing is the root type in the Schema.org hierarchy. All other types inherit from Thing either directly or indirectly.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from Thing:

- Action: An action performed by a direct agent upon a direct object.
- BioChemEntity: Any biological, chemical, or biochemical thing.
- CreativeWork: The most generic kind of creative work.
- Event: An event happening at a certain time and location.
- Intangible: A utility type that groups together intangible things.
- MedicalEntity: The most generic type for medical entities.
- Organization: An organization such as a school, NGO, corporation, club, etc.
- Person: A person (alive, dead, undead, or fictional).
- Place: Entities with a somewhat fixed physical extension.
- Product: Any offered product or service.
- Taxon: A set of organisms representing a natural biological unit.

## Properties

### Direct Properties

- name: The name of the item.
- disambiguatingDescription: A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation.
- potentialAction: Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role.
- url: URL of the item.
- identifier: The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of [[Thing]], such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See [background notes](/docs/datamodel.html#identifierBg) for more details.
        
- subjectOf: A CreativeWork or Event about this Thing.
- description: A description of the item.
- additionalType: An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the
    use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference. In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org <a href="https://schema.org/docs/styleguide.html">style guide</a>.
- image: An image of the item. This can be a [[URL]] or a fully described [[ImageObject]].
- sameAs: URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website.
- alternateName: An alias for the item.
- mainEntityOfPage: Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described. See [background notes](/docs/datamodel.html#mainEntityBackground) for details.

### Inherited Properties

No inherited properties.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface Thing {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'Thing'
  name?: string
  disambiguatingDescription?: string
  potentialAction?: Action
  url?: string
  identifier?: PropertyValue | string
  subjectOf?: CreativeWork | Event
  description?: string
  additionalType?: string
  image?: ImageObject | string
  sameAs?: string
  alternateName?: string
  mainEntityOfPage?: CreativeWork | string
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "Thing",
  "name": "Example Thing",
  "description": "An example of the Thing type",
  "url": "https://example.com/thing",
  "identifier": "example-thing-1"
}
```

## Notes

- Thing is the root type in Schema.org - it has no parent classes
- All Schema.org types extend Thing, either directly or through inheritance
- The properties defined on Thing are available on all other types
- When using Thing directly, consider if a more specific type would be more appropriate
