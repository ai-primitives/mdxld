# Thing

The most generic type of item.

## Type Hierarchy

Thing is the root type in the Schema.org hierarchy. All other types inherit from Thing either directly or indirectly.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from Thing:

- Action: An action performed by a direct agent upon a direct object.
- Organization: An organization such as a school, NGO, corporation, club, etc.
- Intangible: A utility type that groups together intangible things.
- CreativeWork: The most generic kind of creative work.
- Event: An event happening at a certain time and location.
- Product: Any offered product or service.
- Person: A person (alive, dead, undead, or fictional).
- BioChemEntity: Any biological, chemical, or biochemical thing.
- MedicalEntity: The most generic type for medical entities.
- Place: Entities with a somewhat fixed physical extension.
- Taxon: A set of organisms representing a natural biological unit.

## Properties

Thing defines the following core properties that are inherited by all other types:

- name: The name of the item
- description: A description of the item
- url: URL of the item
- identifier: Any kind of identifier for the item
- image: An image of the item
- additionalType: An additional type for the item
- disambiguatingDescription: A description that disambiguates this item from others
- potentialAction: Indicates a potential Action that describes an idealized action
- subjectOf: A CreativeWork or Event about this Thing
- sameAs: URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity
- alternateName: An alias for the item
- mainEntityOfPage: Indicates a page for which this thing is the main entity being described

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface Thing {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'Thing'
  name?: string
  description?: string
  url?: string
  identifier?: PropertyValue | string
  image?: ImageObject | string
  additionalType?: string
  disambiguatingDescription?: string
  potentialAction?: Action
  subjectOf?: CreativeWork | Event
  sameAs?: string
  alternateName?: string
  mainEntityOfPage?: CreativeWork | string
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "Thing",
  "name": "Example Item",
  "description": "An example of the most basic Schema.org type",
  "url": "https://example.com/item",
  "identifier": "example-item-1",
  "disambiguatingDescription": "A demonstration of the Thing type properties",
  "alternateName": "Sample Thing"
}
```

## Notes

- Thing is the root type in Schema.org - it has no parent classes
- All Schema.org types extend Thing, either directly or through inheritance
- The properties defined on Thing are available on all other types
- When using Thing directly, consider if a more specific type would be more appropriate
