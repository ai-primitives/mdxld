## Usage Example

```typescript
interface BedType extends QualitativeValue {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'BedType'

}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "BedType",
  "name": "Example BedType",
  "description": "An example of the BedType type",
  "url": "https://example.com/bedtype",
  "identifier": "example-bedtype-1"
}
```

## Notes

- BedType inherits all properties from QualitativeValue
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
