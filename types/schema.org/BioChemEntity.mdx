# BioChemEntity

Any biological, chemical, or biochemical thing. For example: a protein; a gene; a chemical; a synthetic chemical.

## Type Hierarchy

BioChemEntity is a type of Thing.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from BioChemEntity:

- ChemicalSubstance: A chemical substance is 'a portion of matter of constant composition, composed of molecular entities of the same type or of different types' (source: [ChEBI:59999](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=59999)).
- Gene: A discrete unit of inheritance which affects one or more biological traits (Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene)). Examples include FOXP2 (Forkhead box protein P2), SCARNA21 (small Cajal body-specific RNA 21), A- (agouti genotype).
- MolecularEntity: Any constitutionally or isotopically distinct atom, molecule, ion, ion pair, radical, radical ion, complex, conformer etc., identifiable as a separately distinguishable entity.
- Protein: Protein is here used in its widest possible definition, as classes of amino acid based molecules. Amyloid-beta Protein in human (UniProt P05067), eukaryota (e.g. an OrthoDB group) or even a single molecule that one can point to are all of type :Protein. A protein can thus be a subclass of another protein, e.g. :Protein as a UniProt record can have multiple isoforms inside it which would also be :Protein. They can be imagined, synthetic, hypothetical or naturally occurring.

## Notes

- BioChemEntity inherits all properties from Thing
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
