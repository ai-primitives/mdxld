# BioChemEntity

Any biological, chemical, or biochemical thing. For example: a protein; a gene; a chemical; a synthetic chemical.

## Type Hierarchy

BioChemEntity is a type of Thing.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from BioChemEntity:

- ChemicalSubstance: A chemical substance is 'a portion of matter of constant composition, composed of molecular entities of the same type or of different types' (source: [ChEBI:59999](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=59999)).
- Gene: A discrete unit of inheritance which affects one or more biological traits (Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene)). Examples include FOXP2 (Forkhead box protein P2), SCARNA21 (small Cajal body-specific RNA 21), A- (agouti genotype).
- MolecularEntity: Any constitutionally or isotopically distinct atom, molecule, ion, ion pair, radical, radical ion, complex, conformer etc., identifiable as a separately distinguishable entity.
- Protein: Protein is here used in its widest possible definition, as classes of amino acid based molecules. Amyloid-beta Protein in human (UniProt P05067), eukaryota (e.g. an OrthoDB group) or even a single molecule that one can point to are all of type :Protein. A protein can thus be a subclass of another protein, e.g. :Protein as a UniProt record can have multiple isoforms inside it which would also be :Protein. They can be imagined, synthetic, hypothetical or naturally occurring.

## Properties

BioChemEntity defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from Thing:

- associatedDisease: Disease associated to this BioChemEntity. Such disease can be a MedicalCondition or a URL. If you want to add an evidence supporting the association, please use PropertyValue.
- bioChemInteraction: A BioChemEntity that is known to interact with this item.
- bioChemSimilarity: A similar BioChemEntity, e.g., obtained by fingerprint similarity algorithms.
- biologicalRole: A role played by the BioChemEntity within a biological context.
- hasBioChemEntityPart: Indicates a BioChemEntity that (in some sense) has this BioChemEntity as a part. 
- hasMolecularFunction: Molecular function performed by this BioChemEntity; please use PropertyValue if you want to include any evidence.
- hasRepresentation: A common representation such as a protein sequence or chemical structure for this entity. For images use schema.org/image.
- isEncodedByBioChemEntity: Another BioChemEntity encoding by this one.
- isInvolvedInBiologicalProcess: Biological process this BioChemEntity is involved in; please use PropertyValue if you want to include any evidence.
- isLocatedInSubcellularLocation: Subcellular location where this BioChemEntity is located; please use PropertyValue if you want to include any evidence.
- isPartOfBioChemEntity: Indicates a BioChemEntity that is (in some sense) a part of this BioChemEntity. 
- taxonomicRange: The taxonomic grouping of the organism that expresses, encodes, or in some way related to the BioChemEntity.

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface BioChemEntity {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'BioChemEntity'
  associatedDisease?: MedicalCondition | PropertyValue | string
  bioChemInteraction?: BioChemEntity
  bioChemSimilarity?: BioChemEntity
  biologicalRole?: DefinedTerm
  hasBioChemEntityPart?: BioChemEntity
  hasMolecularFunction?: DefinedTerm | PropertyValue | string
  hasRepresentation?: PropertyValue | string
  isEncodedByBioChemEntity?: Gene
  isInvolvedInBiologicalProcess?: DefinedTerm | PropertyValue | string
  isLocatedInSubcellularLocation?: DefinedTerm | PropertyValue | string
  isPartOfBioChemEntity?: BioChemEntity
  taxonomicRange?: DefinedTerm | Taxon | string
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "BioChemEntity",
  "name": "Example BioChemEntity",
  "description": "An example of the BioChemEntity type",
  "url": "https://example.com/biochementity",
  "identifier": "example-biochementity-1"
}
```

## Notes

- BioChemEntity inherits all properties from Thing
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
