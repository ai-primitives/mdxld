# Event

An event happening at a certain time and location, such as a concert, lecture, or festival. Ticketing information may be added via the [[offers]] property. Repeated events may be structured as separate Event objects.

## Type Hierarchy

Event is a type of Thing.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from Event:

- BusinessEvent: Event type: Business event.
- ChildrensEvent: Event type: Children's event.
- ComedyEvent: Event type: Comedy event.
- CourseInstance: An instance of a [[Course]] which is distinct from other instances because it is offered at a different time or location or through different media or modes of study or to a specific section of students.
- DanceEvent: Event type: A social dance.
- DeliveryEvent: An event involving the delivery of an item.
- EducationEvent: Event type: Education event.
- ExhibitionEvent: Event type: Exhibition event, e.g. at a museum, library, archive, tradeshow, ...
- Festival: Event type: Festival.
- FoodEvent: Event type: Food event.
- Hackathon: A [hackathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) event.
- LiteraryEvent: Event type: Literary event.
- MusicEvent: Event type: Music event.
- PublicationEvent: A PublicationEvent corresponds indifferently to the event of publication for a CreativeWork of any type, e.g. a broadcast event, an on-demand event, a book/journal publication via a variety of delivery media.
- SaleEvent: Event type: Sales event.
- ScreeningEvent: A screening of a movie or other video.
- SocialEvent: Event type: Social event.
- SportsEvent: Event type: Sports event.
- TheaterEvent: Event type: Theater performance.
- UserInteraction: UserInteraction and its subtypes is an old way of talking about users interacting with pages. It is generally better to use [[Action]]-based vocabulary, alongside types such as [[Comment]].
- VisualArtsEvent: Event type: Visual arts event.

## Properties

Event defines the following properties in addition to those inherited from Thing:

- attendee: A person or organization attending the event.
- attendees: A person attending the event.
- doorTime: The time admission will commence.
- eventAttendanceMode: The eventAttendanceMode of an event indicates whether it occurs online, offline, or a mix.
- eventSchedule: Associates an [[Event]] with a [[Schedule]]. There are circumstances where it is preferable to share a schedule for a series of
      repeating events rather than data on the individual events themselves. For example, a website or application might prefer to publish a schedule for a weekly
      gym class rather than provide data on every event. A schedule could be processed by applications to add forthcoming events to a calendar. An [[Event]] that
      is associated with a [[Schedule]] using this property should not have [[startDate]] or [[endDate]] properties. These are instead defined within the associated
      [[Schedule]], this avoids any ambiguity for clients using the data. The property might have repeated values to specify different schedules, e.g. for different months
      or seasons.
- eventStatus: An eventStatus of an event represents its status; particularly useful when an event is cancelled or rescheduled.
- maximumPhysicalAttendeeCapacity: The maximum physical attendee capacity of an [[Event]] whose [[eventAttendanceMode]] is [[OfflineEventAttendanceMode]] (or the offline aspects, in the case of a [[MixedEventAttendanceMode]]). 
- maximumVirtualAttendeeCapacity: The maximum virtual attendee capacity of an [[Event]] whose [[eventAttendanceMode]] is [[OnlineEventAttendanceMode]] (or the online aspects, in the case of a [[MixedEventAttendanceMode]]). 
- organizer: An organizer of an Event.
- performer: A performer at the event&#x2014;for example, a presenter, musician, musical group or actor.
- performers: The main performer or performers of the event&#x2014;for example, a presenter, musician, or actor.
- previousStartDate: Used in conjunction with eventStatus for rescheduled or cancelled events. This property contains the previously scheduled start date. For rescheduled events, the startDate property should be used for the newly scheduled start date. In the (rare) case of an event that has been postponed and rescheduled multiple times, this field may be repeated.
- recordedIn: The CreativeWork that captured all or part of this Event.
- remainingAttendeeCapacity: The number of attendee places for an event that remain unallocated.
- subEvent: An Event that is part of this event. For example, a conference event includes many presentations, each of which is a subEvent of the conference.
- subEvents: Events that are a part of this event. For example, a conference event includes many presentations, each subEvents of the conference.
- superEvent: An event that this event is a part of. For example, a collection of individual music performances might each have a music festival as their superEvent.
- workFeatured: A work featured in some event, e.g. exhibited in an ExhibitionEvent.
       Specific subproperties are available for workPerformed (e.g. a play), or a workPresented (a Movie at a ScreeningEvent).
- workPerformed: A work performed in some event, for example a play performed in a TheaterEvent.
