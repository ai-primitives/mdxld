description: A FloorPlan is an explicit representation of a collection of similar accommodations, allowing the provision of common information (room counts, sizes, layout diagrams) and offers for rental or sale. In typical use, some [[ApartmentComplex]] has an [[accommodationFloorPlan]] which is a [[FloorPlan]].  A FloorPlan is always in the context of a particular place, either a larger [[ApartmentComplex]] or a single [[Apartment]]. The visual/spatial aspects of a floor plan (i.e. room layout, [see wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_plan)) can be indicated using [[image]].

# FloorPlan

A FloorPlan is an explicit representation of a collection of similar accommodations, allowing the provision of common information (room counts, sizes, layout diagrams) and offers for rental or sale. In typical use, some [[ApartmentComplex]] has an [[accommodationFloorPlan]] which is a [[FloorPlan]].  A FloorPlan is always in the context of a particular place, either a larger [[ApartmentComplex]] or a single [[Apartment]]. The visual/spatial aspects of a floor plan (i.e. room layout, [see wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_plan)) can be indicated using [[image]]. 

## Type Hierarchy

FloorPlan is a type of Intangible.

### Direct Subtypes

No types directly inherit from FloorPlan.

## Properties

## Usage Example

```typescript
interface FloorPlan extends Intangible {
  $context?: 'schema.org'
  $type: 'FloorPlan'
  floorSize?: QuantitativeValue
  isPlanForApartment?: Accommodation
  petsAllowed?: boolean | string
  numberOfBedrooms?: QuantitativeValue | number
  numberOfBathroomsTotal?: number
  layoutImage?: ImageObject | string
  numberOfAvailableAccommodationUnits?: QuantitativeValue
  numberOfFullBathrooms?: number
  numberOfAccommodationUnits?: QuantitativeValue
  numberOfRooms?: QuantitativeValue | number
  amenityFeature?: LocationFeatureSpecification
  numberOfPartialBathrooms?: number
}
```

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "$context": "schema.org",
  "$type": "FloorPlan",
  "name": "Example FloorPlan",
  "description": "An example of the FloorPlan type",
  "url": "https://example.com/floorplan",
  "identifier": "example-floorplan-1"
}
```

## Notes

- FloorPlan inherits all properties from Intangible
- Consider using more specific subtypes if available
- Ensure all required properties are provided
- Use appropriate property types as defined in the interface
