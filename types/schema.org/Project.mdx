Use properties from [[Organization]], [[subOrganization]]/[[parentOrganization]] to indicate project sub-structures. 
   

## Type Hierarchy

Project is a type of Organization.

### Direct Subtypes

The following types directly inherit from Project:

- FundingAgency: A FundingAgency is an organization that implements one or more [[FundingScheme]]s and manages
    the granting process (via [[Grant]]s, typically [[MonetaryGrant]]s).

Examples of funding agencies include ERC, REA, NIH, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, ...
